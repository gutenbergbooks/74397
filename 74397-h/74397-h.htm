  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the first volume of this History we had to summarise the
critical work of nearly two thousand years; in the second, that
of two whole centuries, with the major part of that of the third.
In this we have had the apparently more manageable task of
considering the whole work of the nineteenth century only,
with the <span lang="fr"><i>remanets</i></span> (left over, not by accident but design) from
the eighteenth and earlier. Yet it would be a poor compliment
to the reader’s intelligence to waste time in explaining to him
that the weight of the task is very little lightened by the
lessened number of the years with which we have to deal.
And the actual congestion of the volume ought all the less to
be increased by repetition of things already said in former
Prefaces, or by single-stick play with reviewers. Some points,
which seemed to be really worth handling, I have dealt with
in the text; the others I must let alone. I have little fear that
many impartial and competent critics will dispute my claim to
have surveyed the matter with the actual documents in hand,
and not (save in the rare cases specified) from comments and
go-betweens, from abstracts and translations; while such critics
may even grant my “mass,” as some indeed have in their
kindness granted it already, a fair share of “agitating mind,”
under the conditions and with the limitations specified in
the original preface. I may at least hope that I shall not
be charged with</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>in regard to a book which has been the actual work and companion
of seven years in its composition, the result of more
than seven-and-twenty in direct or indirect preparation.</p>

<p class='c001'>After all it is, as Dante says elsewhere, for knowledge “not
to prove but to set forth its subject,” and I do not see any
further necessity to argue against the notion that Criticism,
alone of the departments of literary energy, is to be denied a
simple and straightforward History of its actual accomplishments.
That is what I set myself to give. If other people
want other things, let them go and do them. When the next
History of Criticism is written it will doubtless be, if the author
knows his business, a much better book than mine; but I
may perhaps hope that his might be worse, and would certainly
cost him more time and labour, were it not for this.</p>

<p class='c001'>One final point I think it may be well to take up. A friend
who is at once friendly, most competent, and of a different
complexion in critical thought, objected to me that I “treat
literature as something by itself.” I hastened to admit the
impeachment, and to declare that this is the very postulate
of my book. That literature can be <em>absolutely</em> isolated is, of
course, not to be thought of; nothing human can be absolutely
isolated from the general conditions of humanity, and from the
other functions and operations thereof. But in that <em>comparative</em>
isolation and separate presentation which Aristotle meant
by his caution against confusion of kinds, I do thoroughly
believe. With which profession of faith, and with all renewed
acknowledgments to friends and helpers, especially to Professors
Elton, Ker, and Raleigh for their kindness in reading the
proofs of this volume, I must leave the book to its fate.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'>VOLUME I.</h3>

<p class='c014'>P. 63, note. “<em>Lu</em>dhaus” should be “<em>Su</em>dhaus.” I received from Professor
Gudeman of Cornell University, along with the notice of this misprint, and
some other minor corrections which I gratefully acknowledge, a large number
of much more important animadversions, for noticing which generally I may
make it a pretext. I have the highest respect for their author: and it is quite
natural that to him, as a professed and professional classical philologist, my treatment
should in many respects seem superficial, or amateurish, or even positively
wrong. But on at least one point we are, I fear, irreconcilable. Professor
Gudeman thinks that Kaibel has “settled once for all” the question of the
Περὶ Ὕψους,—has “given incontrovertible proof” that it cannot be later than
the first century. Now, as an old student of Logic and of Law, and as a
literary critic of thirty years’ standing, I absolutely deny the possibility of
“settling once for all,” of “incontrovertible proof,” in this matter as in many
others. The evidence is not extant, if it is existent. It may turn up, but it has
not turned up yet. On this point—the point as to what constitutes <em>literary</em>
evidence and what does not—I am well aware that I am at issue, perhaps
with the majority, at any rate with a large number, of scholars in the
ancient and modern languages; but I am quite content to remain so. As to
another protest of Professor Gudeman’s against my neglect of the latest
editions, I might refer him to Schopenhauer (<i>v. infra</i>, p. 567); but I will only
say that <em>for my purpose</em> the date of an edition is of very little importance,
and the spelling of “<em>G</em>næus” or “<em>C</em>næus,” “<em>iu</em>ris” or “<em>ju</em>ris,” of no importance
at all. I am sorry to appear stiff-necked in reference to criticisms made with
many obliging expressions, but <span lang="de"><i>Ich kann nicht anders</i></span>, as also in reference to
Theophrastus, the Alexandrians, and others, whose substantive works are lost,
but with whom Mr Gudeman would like me to deal in the usual manner of conjectural
and inferential patchwork.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 280. I had not observed (oddly enough) that <em>Clæris</em> had crept into text
and headings, where it has no business, and that “Fabius” was misprinted
“Falinus,” till Professor Gudeman kindly brought both to my notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pp. 410, 411. I owe to Dr Sandys (in <cite>Hermathena</cite>, vol. xii. p. 438) the
removal of certain ignorances or forgetfulnesses here. “Solymarius,” as I most
assuredly ought to have remembered, seeing that the information is in Warton,
was a poem on the Crusades by Gunther, the author of the better known
<cite>Ligurinus</cite> on Barbarossa, and the “Guntero” to whom I myself, in <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/73128/pg73128-images.html#Page_96'>vol. ii. p. 96</a>,
 alluded in connection with Patrizzi. “Paraclitus” and “Sidonius”
were two poems by Warnerius of Basle. I am even more indebted to Dr
Sandys for a sheaf of privately communicated annotations on vol. i., of many
of which I hope to avail myself in a future edition—if such a thing is called
for.</p>

<p class='c014'>P. 23 <i>sq.</i> A reference of Hallam’s (<cite>Literature of Europe</cite>, iii. 5, 76, 77) to
the <cite>Miscellanies</cite> of Politian has led some critics, who apparently do not know
the book itself, and have not even read Hallam carefully, to object to its
omission here. Their authority might have saved them; for he very correctly
describes these <cite>Miscellanies</cite> as “sometimes grammatical, but more frequently
relating to obscure customs and mythological allusions.” In other words, the
book—which <em>I</em> have read—is hardly, in my sense, critical at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 29, note 3, l. 3, <em>for</em> “ii.” <em>read</em> “i.” (The <em>first</em> vol. of Pope.)</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 30, <em>for</em> “with his two great disciples” <em>read</em> “between his master Horace
and his pupil Boileau.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 38, note, <i>for first sentence read</i>: “But most of this latter part had been
written in 1548-49, and all must have been before 1550, when T. died.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 51, l. 7 from bottom, <i>for</i> “Rote” <i>read</i> “Rota.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 67, l. 4, <i>for</i> “prose” <i>read</i> “poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 80, note. When I wrote on Castelvetro I was not aware that the
Commentary on Dante (at least that on <i>Inf.</i>, Cantos i.-xxix.) had been recovered
and published by Signor Giovanni Franciosi (Modena, 1886) in a stately royal
4to (which I have now read, and possess), with the owl and the pitcher, but
without the <em>Kekrika</em>, and without the proper resolution in the owl’s countenance.
This may be metaphysically connected with the fact that the editor is rather
unhappy about his author, and tells us that he was long in two minds about
sending him out at last to the world. He admires Castelvetro’s boldness,
scholarship, intellect; but thinks him sadly destitute of reverence for Dante,
and deplores his “lack of lively and cheerful sense of the Beautiful.” If it
were not that my gratitude to the man who gives me a text seals my mouth
as to everything else, I should be a little inclined to cry “Fudge!” at this.
Nobody would expect from any Renaissance scholar, and least of all from
Castelvetro, “unction,” mysticism, rapture at the things that give <em>us</em> rapture
in Dante. All the more honour to him that, as in the case of Petrarch, he
thought it worth while to bestow on that vernacular, which too many Renaissance
scholars despised, the same intense desire to understand, the same
pains, the same “taking seriously,” which he showed towards the ancients.
This is the true reverence: the rest is but “leather and prunella.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 87, l. 5, <i>for</i> “ideals” <i>read</i> “idols.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 107. Some time after vol. ii. was published I came across (in the catalogues
of Mr Voynich, who might really inscribe on these documents for motto</p>

<p class='c009'>quite a nest of Zinanos, mostly written about that year 1590, which seems to
have been this curious writer’s most active time; and I bought two of them
as specially appurtenant to our subject. One is a <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso della Tragedia</cite></span>,
appended (though separately paged and dedicated) to the author’s tragedy of
<span lang="it"><cite>Almerigo</cite></span>; the other <span lang="it"><cite>Le Due Giornate della Ninfa overo del Diletto e delle Muse</cite></span>,
all printed by Bartholi, at Reggio, and the two prose books or booklets dated
1590. The <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso</cite></span> is chiefly occupied with an attack on the position that
Tragedy (especially according to Aristotle) ought to be busied with true subjects
only. The <span lang="it"><cite>Giornate</cite></span> (which contain another reference to Patrizzi) deal—more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>or less fancifully, but in a manner following Boethius, which is interesting at
so late a date—with philosophy and things in general, rather than with
literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 140, l. 3 from bottom, <i>delete</i> “of” before Catullus.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 162, l. 17. “Thomas” should have been “George,” as it appears correctly
elsewhere: and “fourth” in the note should be “quarto” (“4th,” “4to”).</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 191. “<i>Topmost</i> Verulam” should, of course, be “<i>large-browed</i> Verulam”—a
curious instance of the tricks played by memory. I know <cite>The Palace of
Art</cite> so well as to see it all printed before me; but the treacherous mind’s eye
must have slipped from the epithet of the first line, “topmost <i>oriels</i>,” to the
name of the third.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 248. In the line beginning <span lang="fr"><i>O, débile raison!</i></span> “lors” has been misprinted for
“ores,” thereby spoiling the metre.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 263, l. 12, <i>for</i> “Beni—Pacius” <i>read</i> “Beni and Pazzi (Pacius) as well as
of Heinsius.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 301, note, “<span lang="fr">Grands Écrivains <i>Français</i></span>” should be “G. E. <span lang="fr"><i>de la France</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 319, note. Gibert is, it seems, appended to some edd. of Baillet.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 322, bk. IV. chap. i. I ought, perhaps, to have noticed in this context
a book rather widely spread—Sorel’s <span lang="fr"><cite>De La Connaissance des Bons Livres</cite></span>, Paris,
1671. It contains some not uninteresting things on literature in general, on
novels, poetry, comedy, &#38;c., on the laws of good speaking and writing, on the
“new language of French.” But it is, on the whole, as anybody acquainted with
any part of the voluminous work of the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Francion</cite></span> would expect, mainly
not disagreeable nor ignorant <em>chat</em>—newspaper work before the newspaper.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 350. The opposition of the two “doctors” is perhaps too sharply put.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 376, note, <i>for</i> “Schenck” <i>read</i> “Strunk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 436. I should like to add as a special “place” for Dennis’s criticism, his
comparatively early <i>Remarks on</i> Prince Arthur <i>and Virgil</i> (title abbreviated),
London, 1696. It is, as it stands, of some elaboration; but its author tells
us that he “meant” to do things which would have made it an almost complete
Poetic from his point of view. It is pervaded with that refrain of “this <em>ought</em>
to be” and “that <em>must</em> have been” to which I have referred in the text; and
bristles with purely arbitrary preceptist statements, such as that Criticism cannot
be ill-natured because Good Nature in man cannot be contrary to Justice and
Reason; that a man must not like what he ought not to like—a doctrine underlying,
of course, the whole Neo-classic teaching, and not that only; almost literally
cropping up in Wordsworth; and the very formulation, in categorical-imperative,
of La Harpe’s “monstrous beauty.” The book (in which poet and critic are
very comfortably and equally yoked together) is full of agreeable things; and
may possibly have suggested one of Swift’s most exquisite pieces of irony in its
contention that Mr Blackmore’s Celestial Machines are directly contrary to the
Doctrine of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 449, l. 1, <i>for</i> “is more curious” <i>read</i> “gives rather more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 478, l. 12 from bottom, <i>for</i> “and in some cases” <i>read</i> “in the lady’s
case.”</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 546. Denina. This author is a good instance of the things which the
reader sometimes rather reproachfully demands, when the writer would only
too fain have supplied them. I could write more than a page with satisfaction
on Denina’s <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso sopra le Vicende della Litteratura</cite></span>, which, rather surprisingly,
underwent its second edition in Glasgow at the Foulis press (1763), and which
not only deals at large with the subject in an interesting manner, but accepts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>the <span lang="la"><i>religio loci</i></span> by dealing specially with <em>Scottish</em> literature. But, once more, this
is for a fourth volume—or even a fifth—things belonging to the Thinkable-Unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 550, note. Something like “pie” has been made of this. It should read:
“This Gallicism was <em>not</em> universal. <em>As</em> Mr Ticknor,” &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>P. 554, l. 3. For the <span lang="fr"><i>Paragone</i></span> see the present volume under Conti, Antonio.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='n_283n'></a>P. 283, <a href='#note283n'>note 2</a>. I accepted too hastily the statement that T. Wright contributed

Dr Ibsen is the chief.</p>

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec7.1.1'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Scope of the volume.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The present volume takes the work of no more than one
century, the nineteenth, as a whole; but, according to our
plan, casts back to the eighteenth, and even earlier,
in order to deal with those dissidents or pioneers
who then laid the foundation of the chief critical performances
of the nineteenth itself.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The term Modern.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For this work—foundation and superstructure—there is no
more convenient and suitable appellation than “Modern,” used
neither in the complimentary and rather question-begging
sense which has recently been attached to
it,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> nor in the more slighting one of Shakespeare, but with a
merely accurate and chronological connotation. Some would
call this criticism “Romantic”; but that term, in addition to a
certain vagueness, has the drawbacks both of question-begging
and of provocation. There is no other that has the slightest
claim to enter into competition, though we may have in passing
to refer to such pretenders as “Æsthetic,” “Dogmatic,” “Scientific,”
and what not.</p>

<p class='c001'>The term “Modern” has, moreover,—so long as it is dissociated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>from any such futile belittling of “Ancient” as was
implied in its use during the Quarrel,—the great advantage of
keeping a secondary, but very convenient and in no way objectionable,
opposition to “Ancient” itself. We have seen
that, with much intelligent and judicious, there was more unintelligent
and corrupt, following of the ancients during the
period which we surveyed in the last volume: and that there
was a still more dangerous and hurtful tendency to disfranchise
modern literature as an equal source with ancient for the discovery
of critical truths. Now, if there is a point wholly to
be counted for righteousness, to at least the better part of the
criticism which has prevailed for the last hundred years, and
was a militant force for at least fifty years earlier, it is this
taking into consideration of “Modern” literature, not to the
exclusion of “Ancient,” but on even terms with it. It is no
doubt much easier to say <span lang="la"><i>nullo discrimine habebo</i></span><a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> than to
carry it out, especially as a man grows older. But it is the
cardinal principle of “Modern” criticism that the most modern
of works is to be judged, not by adjustment to anything else,
but on its own merits—that the critic must always behave as
if the book he takes from its wrapper might be a new <cite>Hamlet</cite>
or a new <cite>Waverley</cite>,—or something as good as either, but
more absolutely novel in kind than even <cite>Waverley</cite>,—however
shrewdly he may suspect that it is very unlikely to be any
such thing.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The origins.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The actual investigation of the last volume brought us down
to (and in La Harpe’s case a little beyond) the close of the
eighteenth century itself, and showed us the final
stages of the Neo-Classic dynasty, which still, in
all European countries except Germany, reigned, and even
appeared to govern; but which, not merely in Germany but
to some extent also in England, was on the point of having
the sceptre wrenched out of its hands. We had traced this
critical system from its construction or reconstruction by the
Italians of the sixteenth century onwards; we saw its merits
and its defects. And we saw likewise that, in the usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>general, gradual, incalculable way, opposition to it, conscious or
unconscious, began to grow up at different times and in different
places. This opposition was a plant of early but slow and
fitful growth in England, rather later but more vigorous and
rapid in Germany; while in the Southern countries it hardly
grew at all, and in France was cruelly attacked and kept down,
if not exactly extirpated, by the weeding-hook of authority.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.4'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Need of caution here.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But it does not follow that we can put the finger on this and
that person as having “begun” the new movement. Such an
opinion is always tempting to not too judicious inquirers,
and there has been no lack of books on <span lang="fr"><i>Le
Romantisme des Classiques</i></span> and the like. The fact, of course,
simply is that everything human exists essentially or potentially
in the men of every time; and that you may not only
find books in the running brooks but (what appears at first
more contradictory) dry stones in them: while, on the other
hand, founts of water habitually gush from the midst of the
driest rock. Indagation of the kind is always treacherous, and
has to be conducted with a great deal of circumspection.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.5'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Case of Butler on Rymer, Denham,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It would be difficult to find an author who illustrates this
danger and treachery better than Butler, whom some may
have been surprised not to find in the last volume.
The author of <cite>Hudibras</cite> was born not long after
Milton, and nearly twenty years before Dryden,
who outlived him by the same space. His great
poem did not give much room for critical utterances in literature;
but the <cite>Genuine Remains</cite><a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> are full of it in separate
places, both verse and prose. Take these singly, and you may
make Butler out to be, not merely a critic, but half a dozen
critics. In perhaps the best known of his minor pieces, the
<cite><span lang="fr">Repartees</span> between Cat and Puss</cite>, he satirises “Heroic” Plays, and
is therefore clearly for “the last age,” as also in the savage and
admirable “On Critics who Judge Modern Plays precisely by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the Rules of the Ancients,” which has been reasonably, or
certainly, thought to be directed against Rymer’s blasphemy of
Beaumont and Fletcher, published two years before Butler’s
death. The satirist’s references and illustrations (as in that to
“the laws of good King Howel’s days”) are sometimes too
Caroline to be quotable; but the force and sweep of his
protest is simply glorious. The <cite>Panegyric on Sir John Denham</cite>
is chiefly personal; but if Butler had been convinced that
<cite>Cooper’s Hill</cite> was the <span lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of English poetry he could
hardly have written it: and though the main victim of “To a
Bad Poet” has not been identified,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For so the rhyme be at the verse’s end,</div>
      <div class='line'>No matter whither all the rest does tend”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>could scarcely have been written except against the new poetry.
The “Pindaric Ode on Modern Critics” is chiefly directed
against the general critical vice of snarling, and the passages
on critics and poets in the <cite>Miscellaneous Thoughts</cite> follow suit.
But if we had only the verse <cite>Remains</cite> we should be to some
extent justified in taking Butler, if not for a precursor of the
new Romanticism, at any rate for a rather strenuous defender
of the old.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.6'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>and Benlowes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But turn to the <cite>Characters</cite>. Most of these that deal with
literature are in the general vein which the average seventeenth-century
character-writer took from Theophrastus, though few
put so much salt of personal wit into this as Butler. In “A
Small Poet” the earlier pages might be aimed at almost anybody
from Dryden himself (whom Butler, it is said, did not
love) down to Flecknoe. But there is only one name mentioned
in the piece; and that name, which is made the object of a
furious and direct attack, lightened by some of the
brightest flashes of Butler’s audacious and acrid
humour, is the name of Edward Benlowes.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Now, that Benlowes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>is a person <span lang="fr"><i>taillable et corvéable à merci et à miséricorde</i></span> by any
critical oppressor, nobody who has read him can deny. He is
as extravagant as Crashaw without so much poetry, and as
Cleveland without so much cleverness. But he is a poet, and
a “metaphysical” poet (as Butler was himself in another way),
and an example, though a rather awful example, of that
“poetic fury” which makes Elizabethan poetry. Yet Butler is
more savage with him than with Denham.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact is that Butler’s criticism is merely the occasional
determination of a man of active genius and satiric temper to
matters literary. Absurdities strike him from whatever school
they come; and he lashes them unmercifully whensoever and
whencesoever they present themselves. But he has no general
creed: he speaks merely to his brief as public prosecutor of
the ridiculous, and also as a staunch John Bull. If he had
been writing at the time when his <cite>Remains</cite> were first actually
published, it is exceedingly probable that he would have
“horsed” Gray as pitilessly as he horses Benlowes; if he
had been writing sixty years later still, that he would have
been as “savage and Tartarly” to Keats and Shelley, or
seventy years later, to Tennyson, as the <cite>Quarterly</cite> itself.
This is not criticism: and we must look later and more
carefully before we discern any real revolution in literary
taste.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.7'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Of Addison and others.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is even very unsafe to attempt to discover much definite
and intentional precursorship in Addison, who was born sixty
years after Butler. There is no need to repeat what
has been said of what seems to me misconception
as to his use of the word Imagination: nor is this the point
which is principally aimed at here. But the more we examine
Addison’s critical utterances, whether we agree with Hurd or
not that they are “shallow,” we shall, I think, be forced to
conclude that any depth they may have has nothing to do with
Romanticism. Addison likes Milton, no doubt, because he is
a sensible man and a good critic, as a general reason. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>when we come to investigate special ones we shall find that
he likes him rather because he himself is a Whig, a pupil of
Dryden, and a religious man—nay, perhaps even because he
really does think that Milton carries out the classical idea of
Epic—than because of Milton’s mystery, his “romantic vague,”
his splendour of diction and verse and imagery. So, too,
the admiration of <cite>Chevy Chase</cite> is partly a whim or a joke,
partly determined by the fact that at that time the Whigs
were the “Jingoes,” and that <cite>Chevy Chase</cite> is very pugnacious
and very patriotic. Nowhere, from the articles on True and
False Wit to the Imagination papers, do we find any real
sense of unrest or dissatisfaction with the accepted theory of
poetry. There is actually more in Prior, with all his profanation
of the <cite>Nut-browne Maid</cite> and his distortions of the
Spenserian stanza.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.8'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>Of La Bruyère and</i> <span lang="fr">“Tout est dit.”</span></div>

<p class='c001'>So if we look backward a little, and a little southward, we
shall, despite the praise which we were able to accord to
some critical dicta of La Bruyère, find very little
reason to regard that admirable master of Addison
himself as a “Romantic before Romanticism.” He
is a sensible man with a fairly catholic taste: but
that is all. Nay, his principle of <span lang="fr"><i>Tout est dit</i></span>, though not
quite irresistibly in practice, almost certainly leads to the
conclusion that the oldest writers are likely to be the best,
and to the habit of extending to new writers, or to the mass
of precedent writing, a rather lukewarm welcome and a distinctly
prejudiced criticism. In a certain sense, no doubt, all
<em>has</em> been said long ago—in gist, in matter, in subject. But
then in literature, and especially in poetry, there is so much
which is beside the gist, that is superadded to the matter,
that does <em>not</em> depend upon the subject! The thoughts suggested
by birth and death, by dawn and sunset, by a blush
and a smile, by the red wine when it moveth itself aright in
the glass, and the green sea stretching from the white cliff-foot,
and the “huge and thoughtful night,” will always be at
bottom and in essence the same. But he must be a blind
person who does not see that at any moment any poet who <em>can</em>
may give them an entirely new form and cast and presentation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In this sense—and it is the sense of the best “modern”
criticism—“<span lang="fr">tout est <i>à dire</i></span>.”</p>

<a id='sec7.1.9'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Of Fénelon and Gravina.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We may seem to have got into an <span lang="fr"><i>impasse</i></span>: nor will such
excellent persons as Fénelon, and to go to yet another country,
Gravina,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> help us out of it. Fénelon indeed had, as
we saw, some striking resipiscences, some individual
pronouncements which, if they were as unaccompanied by
others as they are disconnected from them, would be very
promising indeed. But this very company that they do <em>not</em>
keep disestates them unluckily: and you cannot doubt, as you
read <span lang="fr"><cite>Télémaque</cite></span>, that if the world had had to depend upon its
author for leadership in the migration from the critical House
of Bondage, it would never have got over the Red Sea, if it
had even started on the journey. Gravina, to that general
perspicacity and equity which distinguishes all these doubtful
cases, added an unusually early and thorough appreciation of
<em>Greek</em>, and the advantage, peculiar to an Italian, of having an
actual classical period of modern literature extending over
four entire centuries: of all which he made good use. But
it is at least very difficult to discover, either in his original
work or in the general trend of his critical utterances, any
dissatisfaction with the prevailing direction of criticism in his
time, or any determination to take a wider outlook.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.10'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Of Dryden and Fontenelle.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, putting aside Dryden (whose method led straight to
the Promised Land, and whose utterances show that he occasionally
saw it afar off) as one who came too early
to feel any very conscious desire of setting out on
the pilgrimage of discovery, Fontenelle is perhaps
the very earliest critic of distinction who shows a decided
restlessness. And he, as we have sufficiently set forth, has
too much of the critical Puck about him to be a safe guide for
the wayfaring man. In fact, “Lord! what fools these mortals
be!” is an exclamation which is always hovering on the door
of his lips, and sometimes all but escapes it.</p>

<a id='sec7.1.11'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The more excellent way.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But this history must have been told to very little purpose
if readers still expect sharp and decided turns, assignable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>definite hours and particular men, in the evolutions of criticism.
Rather has it been one of our special lessons—it
would be uncritical to say our special objects—to
prove that these things are not to be expected. It is a part
of the Neo-Classic error itself to assume some definite goal of
critical perfection towards which all things tend, and which,
when you have attained it, permits you to take no further
trouble except of imitation and repetition. Just as you never
know what new literary form the human genius may take,
and can therefore never lay down any absolute and final
schedule of literary kinds, and of literary perfection within
these kinds, so you can never shape the set of the prevalent
taste, and you can never do much more than give the boat
the full benefit of the current by dexterous rowing and steering.
Indeed, as we have seen, the taste in criticism and the
taste in creation unite, or diverge, or set dead against each
other in a manner quite incalculable, and only interpretable
as making somehow for the greater glory of Literature. Somewhere
about the time to which we have harked back—the
meeting of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or a little
later, or much later, as the genius of different countries and
persons would have it—a veering of the wind, an eddy of the
current, <em>did</em> take place. And it is of this that we have to give
account in the present Book—of the consequences of it that we
have to give an account in the present volume.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Starting point of this volume.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It should not be necessary to make much further observation
of the linking kind between this volume and the last; but
a few more words may be desirable on the fact
that from a very early period of the eighteenth
century itself there were perceptible underground
mutterings of revolt; and that, steadily or fitfully, another
current of criticism, fed likewise by springs underground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><a id='sec7.2.2'></a><span class='sni side15'><i>Neo-Classic complacency and exclusiveness illustrated from Callières.</i></span>
made its appearance side by side with, but running counter
to, the orthodox, yet almost entirely neglected by orthodoxy.
Orthodoxy indeed, in its special home, would have specially
emphasised the scornful question, “Can any good thing come
out of <em>Germany</em>?” The <em>locus</em> of Bouhours is hackneyed, and
has been quoted already (ii. 315). But nothing can better
show the state of complacent fatuity to which Neo-Classicism,
<em>plus</em> national conceit, had reduced the French at the close of
the seventeenth century, than the “Laws of Apollo,” which,
in the twelfth book of the treatise which has the
honour to have given suggestions to Swift, Callières<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
represents the god as promulgating to appease the
strife of Ancients and Moderns. <span lang="fr"><i>Les trois nations
polies</i></span> are the French, the Italians, and the
Spaniards: all others are more or less barbarians. These
barbarians (including not only the Germans, but the nation
which had to its credit Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton,
and Dryden, with others who, if lesser than these, were the
equals of the two or three best of France) may be allowed to
write Latin as a concession to the literary incompetence of
their own tongues; but the polished nations should not do so.
Homer is the greatest of all poets, and Virgil the second; the
third place had better remain vacant. No witchcraft or
romance of chivalry is to be admitted into poetry. Acrostics
and anagrams are to be banished from it. <span lang="fr"><i>Et patati et patata.</i></span>
Apollo himself could at the time hardly have got into the
head of Callières, not merely academician but diplomatist as
he was, what an utterly ridiculous figure he would cut to all
but the most philosophical and tolerant of posterity. Yet be
it remembered that Gottsched held no different creed nearly
fifty years after in Germany itself, and La Harpe no very
different one more than a hundred years after in France; while
among ourselves, and halfway between these two, even such
iconoclasts in other ways as Adam Smith and David Hume
would have made very little difficulty about accepting it.
The overthrow of a belief of such prevalence, such toughness,
such duration, cannot have been achieved but by agencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>widespreading, patient, various: and it is these agencies that
we must now investigate.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.3'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Béat de Muralt.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Not very many years later than the <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Poétique</cite></span> there
was written, in French also, but not by a Frenchman, a
document curiously different in tenor, though by
no means ostensibly, or indeed to any great extent
really, breaking with Neo-Classicism. The Swiss—as their
peculiar position, not merely politically in the midst of
Europe, but racially as overlapping and overlapped by France,
Germany, and Italy, made almost necessary—had begun early
to take a sort of bystander-view of European Literature. The
excellent essay of Herr Hamelius<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> was perhaps the first recent
document to attract much attention to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres sur les
Anglois et sur les Francois</cite></span> of Béat Louis de Muralt. Muralt was
a French-writing but a German-speaking Swiss; he says (rather
to his disadvantage as a critic, but usefully on this head) that
<span lang="fr">“H<em>ou</em>mour”</span> is <span lang="fr">“ce que <em>nous</em> appellons</span> <span lang="de"><i>Einfall</i></span>,” and what the
French mean by <span lang="fr">“dire de bons mots,”</span> from which we can at
least see that the excellent M. de Muralt had not the faintest
notion of what Humour specifically is. He travelled in
England during the last decade of the seventeenth century;
but his <span lang="fr"><cite>Letters</cite></span> upon us and the French were not published till
1727, in 12mo, with no imprint of place. They acquired, after
the fashion of the time, a sort of “snow-ball” increment of
comment by apologists (a “Lord,” of course, for England), and
are chiefly valuable as symptoms. <a id='sec7.2.4'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>His attention to English,</i></span> Muralt is, as we should
expect, much more occupied with manners than with letters;
and in fact, as regards English, deals in detail with hardly
any literary kind save comedy. Here (as the <span lang="la"><i>orbis
terrarum</i></span> often remarks of our <span lang="la"><i>alter orbis</i></span>) he thinks
that we have too good an opinion of ourselves: <span lang="fr">“Sur toutes
sortes de sujets il faut qu’ils se préfèrent au reste du monde.”</span>
He thinks Corneille and Molière (whom he would specially
avenge) ill-treated by the English dramatists who borrow from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>them. He accuses Dryden—not by name, but transparently
and truly as “the most famous of their poets”—of stealing
from Corneille and abusing him; neither of which articles is
just. On the other hand, he is certainly too complimentary
(though Saint-Evremond<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> was responsible for the exaggeration)
in calling Shadwell “<em>one of</em> the most famous” of the
same poets; and we may abandon <em>The Miser</em> to his arrows.
He admits that our literature outside the theatre is “full of
good sense and originality,” but says little about it. He has
himself the good sense to object to Louis Quatorze dress, for
Romans and Carthaginians, on both stages.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and to French.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>He is much more copious on French Literature; and his
judgments here are more interesting, because he is at a more
original angle. Much of his outlook is purely Neo-Classic.
He has a thorough belief in Kinds; he
has abundance to say “in the <em>aib</em>stract” about <span lang="fr"><i>bon sens</i></span> and
<span lang="fr"><i>bel esprit</i></span>; and for one writing so late he is surprisingly copious
on Voiture and Sarrasin and Balzac. He thinks Rabelais quite
“beneath humanity,”—having indeed, here and elsewhere, a good
deal of solid German morals about him. The most surprising
thing is his attitude to Boileau, whom he pronounces to have
plenty of sense and art, but no great genius. This attitude,
and the taking of English literature into serious literary consideration
for almost the first time on the Continent, since Lilius
Giraldus,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> are the things which, from the literary side, deserve
most note in Muralt.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> And the latter—not by any means
merely from that point of view of “preferring ourselves to
others”—is the most important of all. So long as general
critical attention to modern literature was confined to French,
Italian, and Spanish, all intimately connected with and indebted
to each other, and all descended from Latin, no real “fermentation”
could take place. The English yeast set it going at once,
in Germany as elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Muralt, however, was an exceptional and cosmopolitan sort
of person, and the note which he sounded was not immediately
taken up, though it is very noteworthy that when it was, it
was again in Switzerland.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.6'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>German Criticism proper.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The  account  which  we  gave  of  German criticism proper
before 1700, and of that part of it which belongs to the Neo-Classic
dispensation after that date, was avowedly
scanty: the reasons for this apparent stinginess
being twofold—the comparative paucity of the
materials, and even more the comparative unimportance of
almost all those that do exist. But we undertook in a manner
to make good the seeming slight; and it is our present business
to do so.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>A glance backward.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We saw that up to the eighteenth century, and indeed nearly
up to the end of its first quarter, German criticism had done
very little, and that it was never to do much in the
direction of “correctness.” Indirectly, however, in
the later half of the seventeenth century, when the <span lang="la"><i>furia</i></span> of the
Thirty Years’ War had in a manner sunk to rest, something
was done in the way of preliminary fermentation both by the
late  inoculation  of  Germany  with the  Euphuist-Marinist-Gongorist
measles, which is there identified chiefly with the
names of Lohenstein and Hoffmanswaldau, and by reaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>against this,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> while something further has, at least by some,
been considered to have been done by Gottsched himself.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Theobald Hoeck.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The works of this period are not, I believe, very common
even in Germany, but the unwearied intelligence with which
the British Museum has been managed for the last
two generations has supplied English readers with a
very fair, though not yet quite satisfying, proportion of the
most important. The earliest of these authors—a predecessor
of Opitz even, who might, and perhaps should, have been
mentioned in the last volume—was Theobald Hoeck, or as he
is called on the title-page of his quaintly-named <cite>Poems</cite>,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Othoblad
Oeckhe. Hoeck makes the nineteenth chapter of his
“Fair Field of Flowers” an ode of fourteen five-lined stanzas,
<span lang="de"><cite>Von Art der Deutschen Poeterey</cite></span>, which perhaps ranks next to,
and certainly marks the new departure from, the vernacular
Meister-song <cite>Arts</cite> referred to above.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> But the style and the
gist of the piece are, I think, fairly enough shown in the
following stanza—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">“Warumb sollen wir denn unser Teutsche Sprache[n]</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">In gwisse Form und Gsatz nit auch mögen machen,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Und Deutsches Carmen schreiben,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Die Kunst zu treiben</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Bey Mann und Weiben?”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But it is hard for the poet when he has both metre and rhyme
to look to—when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">“Mann muss die <em>Pedes</em> gleich so wol scandiren</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Den dactylum und auch Spondaeum rieren,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>and at the same time see that his rhymes are proper. The
thing is interesting as exhibiting modern German poetry in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>go-cart with laudable anxiety on the part of the infant to go
rightly.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Weckherlin and others.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The chief ferment, however, of German poetic and criticism
of a kind did not come till towards the middle of the century
and when the Thirty Years’ War was dying down
(though it is thought to have been to some extent
determined by the sojourning of at least one German of letters<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
in England quite in the earlier stage of that convulsion): and
it took final colour from French rather than from English,
partly in the form of Pléiade and Louis Treize <span lang="la"><i>ampullæ</i></span>, partly
in that of “correctness” (as far as the Germans could reach it)
<span lang="fr"><i>à la</i></span> Boileau. The earlier inquirers, such as Schottel, Zesen,
Buchner, were painful and estimable rhetoricians, anxious to get
German into good scholastic ways. Schottel, in his <span lang="de"><cite>Teutsche
Sprachkunst</cite></span><a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and other works, is quite of the old fashion in
compounding rhetoric-poetic-composition books with dictionary.
Zesen’s <span lang="de"><cite>Hochdeutscher Helikon</cite></span><a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> is an extremely fat little book,
the component parts of which are separately paged, and sometimes
not paged at all, and which discusses with the utmost care
the terms of the art in metre, rhyme, stanza-building, &#38;c., gives
rhyming dictionaries first of masculine then of feminine rhymes,
supplies plenteous example-verse, and finishes with a <span lang="la"><i>De Poetica</i></span>
of a more general kind. Augustine Buchner<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> is still older-fashioned,
and reminds one of the sixteenth-century Italians in
his little tractate on the office and aim of poetry, its kinds,
ornaments, &#38;c.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.10'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Weise, Wernicke, Werenfels, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These are hardly at all critical; they are rhetorical-preceptist.
But the later men, such as Weise, Wernicke, and Werenfels,
exhibit the revolt against the school of conceit and
bombast which in the later part of the seventeenth
century radiates from France all over Europe.
Christian Weise, <em>Professor Poeseos</em> as he called
himself, degrades Poetry in his <span lang="de"><cite>Curiose Gedanken neben
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Deutschen Versen</cite></span> (1691) to the position of a mere <span lang="la"><i>ancilla</i></span> of
Rhetoric, and seems to have anticipated Shaftesbury in making
“ridicule the test of truth.” His namesake, Wernicke, in the
<span lang="la">“Ad Lectorem”</span> of his <span lang="de"><cite>Poetische Versuche</cite></span>,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> extols Longinus, and
makes “polite” remarks on Lohenstein and Hoffmanswaldau.
But <em>the</em> German manifesto against the florid is the <span lang="la"><cite>Dissertatio
de Meteoris Orationis</cite></span> appended to the <span lang="la"><cite>De Logomachiis Eruditorum</cite></span>
of Samuel Werenfels, which appeared at Amsterdam
within the eighteenth century,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> dedicated to no less a person
than Gilbert Burnet, but presents the matter of two theses
composed fourteen and ten years earlier. The <span lang="la"><cite>De Logomachiis</cite></span>
itself has a certain interest for us, as it hits among other things
at frivolous and verbal criticism; but the <span lang="la"><cite>Dissertatio</cite></span> is all ours.
Werenfels, as usual basing himself upon Longinus, without the
slightest suspicion that he will be undone by his reliance,
distinguishes between ὕψηλα and μετέωρα—our old friends
the True and the False Sublime. He admits the importance of
Imagination, but will have it strictly ruled by Judgment, and
makes another distinction (not without acuteness) between
good Figures and bad. He harks as far back as Longolius
and the Ciceronians for examples of literary will-worship; but
is evidently thinking throughout rather of gorgeousness than
of over-precision, and directs his attacks specially at Claudian
among the ancients, though he names Gongora among the
moderns. His final decision is that Italians, Spaniards, and
Germans are all painfully given to the meteoric; the French
are <span lang="fr"><i>saniores</i></span>.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.11'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>Some mutineers: Gryphius and Neumeister.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The germaner spirit of Germany, however,—to speak “meteorically”
and in character,—was by no means quenched by
these <span lang="fr"><i>douches</i></span> of correctness, and continued to assert
itself at intervals between the practice of the
Silesians and the theory of the Swiss. The most
considerable German dramatist of the seventeenth
century, Andreas Gryphius, not merely neglected the “classical”
rules in his plays, but made light of them in prefaces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and lectures. Just before the end of the century, Erdmann
Neumeister (who was to live sixty years longer and overlap
the time of Goethe), enthusiastically recommending the fashionable
opera, dismisses the rules with a contemptuous inaccuracy<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
much more humiliating than any polemic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without therefore wandering longer in these side-walks, we
may say that they form a real approach to the Romantic Revolt
of the next century, quite as much as—perhaps more than—they
lead to the Gottschedian preciseness. And this should
sufficiently justify the notice of them here.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Gottsched once more.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The most important—perhaps one might say the only important—critical
document furnished by Gottsched himself to
our general history is the <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Dichtung</cite></span>, which
has been already disposed of,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and this is a document
of the extremest Neo-Classicism. But he did not reach this
point at once: and the successive hardenings of heart by which
he did reach it are a curious topsy-turvy document in the other
sense—a document of the growth of Romanticism, and its effect
in making its enemies the more stubborn. These stages have
been traced diligently and clearly, if perhaps with a little
unnecessary <span lang="la"><i>animus</i></span> and polemic, by Herr Braitmaier.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> When
the appearance of the <span lang="de"><cite>Diskurse der Maler</cite></span> (<i>The</i>v. infra) induced
Gottsched (who is allowed by friends and foes to have had a
very shrewd literary sense of the journalist’s or publisher’s
kind) to imitate them in the periodical entitled <span lang="de"><cite>Die Vernünftigen
Tadlerinnen</cite></span><a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a>—“The Intelligent Blamingwomen” or
“Carperesses”—his attitude was not at first very different from
that of his then friends, Bodmer and Breitinger, in appearance
at least. But he proceeded to pay attention (perhaps guided
by them) to French criticism: and he henceforward followed it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>more and more to do evil in another periodical, the <span lang="de"><cite>Biedermann</cite></span>,
in the successive editions of his <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Dichtkunst</cite></span>, with increasing
intensity in the important <span lang="de"><cite>Beiträge zur Kritischen Historie
der Deutschen <a id='corr20.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sprache'>Sprache,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_20.4'><ins class='correction' title='Sprache'>Sprache,</ins></a></span> Poesie und Beredsamkeit</cite></span>, which
he directed from 1732 to 1744, and lastly, in the pamphlets
and articles of the so-called Swiss-Saxon or Leipzig-Zürich
war.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the claims of Gottsched to be not a mere critical
fossil, but a real reformer and even a kind of precursor of the
great German literary school, in criticism as well as on creation,
from Lessing to Goethe, they were first put forward many
years ago by Danzel, and after the usual manner of literary
whitewashings of the paradoxical kind, have been accepted by
some since. But they never could have commended themselves
to impartial and instructed students of literary history: and
they have been quite sufficiently disposed of by Herr Braitmaier.
One may fully take the view which was put forward
towards the end of the last volume about Gottsched’s critical
worth, and yet have formed it with full knowledge of the fact
that he was an active and well-intentioned worker in that
enormous effort towards self-improvement to which justice
has there been done. But the notion that he was really a
fellow-worker with the Swiss school is, I must repeat, mistaken;
and the further notions of his having played the part
of Dante, or at least of Du Bellay, towards the purification
and exaltation of German language, and almost that of Dryden
towards the refashioning of German literature, are but fond
things.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Bodmer and Breitinger.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The two Swiss professors, Bodmer and Breitinger, who have
already several times been named, form one of the most curious
pairs of brothers-in-arms whereof literary story
makes mention. They were both born in or near
the same town, Zürich; the long lives of both (though Breitinger’s
was a little the shorter at both ends) nearly coincided;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>both were christened John James; and they very early began,
and long continued, to qualify themselves for the position of
heroes of a new “Legend of Friendship” without even finding
it necessary to begin with a fight like Spenser’s Cambel and
Triamond. Both pugnacious, they always took the same side
in their battles; they prefaced each other’s books alternately,
and sometimes finding even this association not close enough,
signed them jointly J. J. J. J. In this kind of society it is
generally difficult to be certain whether even the writings
which appear to belong to one writer only do not contain a
good deal of the other’s, and therefore to assign a sharply
differential character to either: nor is it really of much importance.
The general opinion, I believe, is that Bodmer had
more originality and enterprise, Breitinger a sounder judgment,
wider learning, and a more philosophical <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span>: but in such
collaborations the parts are almost always thus distributed.
There can, however, be no reasonable question that the pair
were—more than any other pair or person—responsible for the
Rally of Germany: or rather, to use the phrase of our saner
custom, that they mark the turn of the tide which neither
they nor any one could have caused. Nor is it surprising to
find that this turn is at first almost imperceptible.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.14'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The</i> <span lang="de">Diskurse der Maler.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Discourses of the Painters</cite> took its title directly from a sort
of coterie which Bodmer had founded; and was named, probably
after Italian models, but indirectly, as no doubt was
the coterie also, from the strong prominence in the
founder’s mind of the doctrine <span lang="la"><i>ut pictura poesis</i></span>. Started in
1721, the periodical was one, and the most important, of these
imitations of <cite>The Spectator</cite> which, as has been said, played so
great a part not merely in English, but in Continental, and
especially German, culture. Like the model, the copy was
intended to reform manners and morals, speech and style.
In the latter respect Bodmer did not merely follow Addison,
but fell back to some extent on the French preceptists of
“correctness,” cheerfully echoing Boileau’s recommendations of
“nature,” though his eclecticism already appears in admiration
of Fontenelle likewise. As Boileau himself had made awful
examples of the extravagants of the Louis XIII. time, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Addison had denounced “false wit,” conceits, and so forth, so
did Bodmer take up his parable anew against the bombast
and preciousness of the Lohenstein School in German.
Like both, he believes thoroughly in “Taste,” though the
“German paste” in him is not contented without an attempt
at a more philosophical treatment of this than either the
Frenchman or the Englishman had thought necessary. He
makes something of a theory of Poetry as Imitation of Nature:
he refines upon the doctrines about Imagination which he finds
in Addison. But in all this there is not very much advance
upon Addison himself. Bodmer has only been brought by
Addison to the threshold of Milton, and, it would seem, not
even to that of Shakespeare,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> while the divine, the instinctive,
the all-saving caution, <cite>antiquam exquirite matrem</cite>, does not
in the case of old German poetry carry him beyond Opitz
as yet.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.15'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>Gradual divergence from their standpoint; König on “Taste.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For some years, therefore, it was quite possible for Swiss
and Saxons to work together. The literature of the Ancient
and Modern quarrel had much influence on both;
and that odd upshot of it, the Fénelonian and La
Mothian dislike to rhyme, was destined to exercise
a very great influence in Germany. For a time,
however, attention was principally fixed on the
general subject of “Taste,”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> and a dispute, really important
in its results, if not exactly in itself, grew up round a short
dissertation by the Saxon Poet-Laureate König, and led, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>other things, to an exchange of letters between Bodmer and
the Italian Conti,<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> on the nature of this much-discussed quality
or faculty. König’s work appeared in 1727, two years before
the first edition of Gottsched’s <span lang="de"><cite>Dichtkunst</cite></span>, but in the same year
with a treatise on Imagination from the Swiss side, in which
may be seen the first sketch of their elaborate dealings with
Poetics many years later.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.16'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Main works of the Swiss School.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>By this time the tendencies of the contending parties—of
Bodmer and Breitinger in the Æsthetic-Romantic direction, and
of Gottsched in the Classical-Preceptist—had been
strengthened and developed, in the one case by
study of Milton specially, in the other by that
of the French: and the gulf between them was deepened
and widened in various writings, especially in the successive
editions of Gottsched’s <span lang="de"><cite>Dichtkunst</cite></span>, and in occasional utterances
of his <span lang="de"><cite>Beiträge</cite></span>. But the great manifestos of the Swiss school—four
in number, but it would seem representing a larger and
more uniform scheme, of which the <cite>Imagination</cite> had been the
pioneer—did not appear till nearly twenty years after the first
publication of the <span lang="de"><cite>Diskurse</cite></span>. Three of them came out at
Zürich in the single year 1740; the fourth, a year later, in
1741. The titles given below require no comment in their
exhibition of the odd enlacements of the pair.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span></div>
<a id='sec7.2.17'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Breitinger’s</i> <span lang="de">Kritische Dichtkunst,</span> &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of these the <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Dichtung</cite></span> is the largest, the most
ambitious, and, according to Herr Braitmaier, the most important.
It was certainly that which hurt and
shocked Gottsched most, and which drew from him
the pathetically ludicrous expostulation with its
unpractical character, which was quoted in the
last volume.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> And no doubt it must appear so to those who
pay most attention to the theory of poetry in general. As
the very title shows, Breitinger here nails the poetic-pictorial
principle to the mast, and he defends it in the book itself,
and in the Dissertation on Similes, which is a sort of tender
to it, with no insufficient learning and variety of application,
with reinforcements of philosophy from <a id='corr24.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Leibniz'>Leibnitz</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_24.13'><ins class='correction' title='Leibniz'>Leibnitz</ins></a></span> and Wolff,
even with the sketching of a “Logic of Phantasy,” which is
to be regulator and administrator of things poetical.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.18'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Bodmer’s</i> Von Dem Wunderbaren, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>From my point of view, however, the most important of the
four is the <span lang="de"><cite>Abhandlung von dem Wunderbaren</cite></span> by Bodmer, and
next to this, the same writer’s elaborate examination,
in the <span lang="de"><cite>Poetische Gemahlde</cite></span>, of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, and
of that <span lang="de"><cite>Durchlauchstigste Syrerin Aramena</cite></span>, which
is one of the chief German Heroic Romances, and
one of the literary achievements of the House of Brunswick,
having been written by Duke Anton Ulrich. The generalities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of the <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Dichtkunst</cite></span> are, no doubt, as one of the
characters in <cite>Westward Ho!</cite> says, “all very good and godly”:
but the unfortunate Gottsched, if he had had a little more
wit, might so have couched his complaint of their unpracticality
that it would not have been ridiculous. “Logics of
Phantasy” are all very well: doctrines that the poet must
be thus and thus minded are all very well. But we want
<em>poems</em>, we want imaginative literature itself; and these were
the most difficult things in the world to get in the first half
of the eighteenth century. Bodmer, in dealing with prose
fiction, recognises, as few critics had recognised, the second
greatest division of the imaginative literature of the world—greater
even than drama in a way, because it borrows nothing
from poetry, but stands on its own merits,—the division which
was at last slowly rising from the ocean where it had been
so long submerged. And in the <cite>Dissertation on the Wonderful</cite>
he boldly unlocked the tabooed treasury wherein men had
been so long forbidden to seek the true riches of poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was the real <em>labor</em>, the real <em>opus</em>. It is not too much
to say that the prevailing doctrine—during the seventeenth
century increasingly, and at the beginning of the eighteenth
as a recognised orthodoxy—made poetry almost impossible.
In spite of the grudging permission of such inadequate safety-valves
as <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>beau désordre</i></span>, “lucky license,” and the
rest, this doctrine was that even the <span lang="de"><i>Wunderbar</i></span> had got to
submit itself to the <span lang="de"><i>Wahrscheinlich</i></span>, with a very distinct understanding
that it was far the safer way to attend to the Verisimilar
and let the Wonderful alone. Even Bodmer himself seems
to have been rather led to a sounder creed by his admiration
for Milton and his revolt against such things as Voltaire’s condemnation
of parts of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> than by a clear, straightforward
apperception of the prerogative of Wonder. Even he
proceeds rather by extension of “machinery,” by pointing out
the capabilities and interest of the use of Angels and the like,
than by any thorough-going anticipation of the Coleridgean
“suspension of disbelief.” But this was very natural and
almost necessary: while it may be pointed out that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>attention to the Prose Romance—in which, for this reason or
that, the unexpected and the exceptional had always held
rather a prominent place—tended in the same direction as
his doctrine of the Wonderful in Poetry.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.19'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Special criticisms of both.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is, however, only fair to say that neither Breitinger nor
Bodmer fails in that critical examination of actual literature
which, as it has been one of the objects of this book
to show, is the most fruitful way of the critic.
Bodmer’s study of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, which he translated,
nay, even that of Opitz, who was edited by the pair,
provided perhaps the most important element in his critical
education. And whatever gaps there may have been in their
literary accomplishment, they knew and used the greatest
critics of antiquity. If they did not know or use all its
greatest poets, they used what they did know freshly and independently.
They knew French and Italian literature fairly,
and Breitinger at least had studied the Ancient and Modern
Quarrel. They knew something of English besides Milton,
though little or nothing of “Sasper,” and their earnest and
affectionate study of German literature itself, reaching by-and-by
to the treasures of the “Middle High” period, is, to me at
least, one of their greatest titles to credit. They may have
pushed the picture-poetry notion too far—Lessing was at the
door with a veritable “two-handed engine” to cut off any
superfluity here. But in their time, and in all times, it could
but do more good than harm.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.20'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Bodmer’s verse criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With the commentatorial side of their activity may be connected
the four verse pieces edited with much care by Herr
Baechtold in the <span lang="de"><cite>Deutsche Literatur-Denkmale</cite></span>.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The
two last of these, dating from the author’s latest
years, when he felt himself among those that knew
not Joseph—<span lang="la"><cite>Untergang der Beruhmten Namen</cite></span>, and <span lang="de"><cite>Bodmer nicht
verkannt</cite></span>—are in hexameters, and are only pathetic curiosities.
The first, <span lang="de"><cite>Character der Teutschen Gedichte</cite></span>, 1734, with an appendix,
<span lang="de"><cite>Versuch einer Kritik über die Deutschen Dichter</cite></span>, and a
second but more independent sequel, <span lang="de"><cite>Die Drollingerische Muse</cite></span>
(Drollinger was a poet and friend of Bodmer’s who had just
died), have more substantive interest.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> They are in Alexandrines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>duly arranged with masculine and feminine alternation,
and contain not a little mostly sound criticism of mostly
much-forgotten bards.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.21'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>Their later work in mediæval poetry, and their general position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I find myself, perhaps necessarily from the difference of our
points of view, again in disagreement with Herr Braitmaier as
to the critical importance of Bodmer’s later industry
(shared again in part by Breitinger) on older German
literature. To me, the mere fact that Bodmer in
1748—that is to say, before the middle of the
eighteenth century, and nearly twenty years before
the appearance of Percy’s <span lang="fr"><i>Reliques</i></span>—published with his faithful
double J. J. his <cite>Specimens of Old Suabian Poetry</cite>, the Middle
High German poetry of the thirteenth century; nine or ten
years later, and still before Percy, before Hurd, <span lang="de"><cite>Fabeln aus der
Zeiten der Minnesänger</cite></span>; with, later again, parts of the <span lang="de"><cite>Nibelungenlied</cite></span>
and collections of Minnesong itself, is, as perhaps the
reader knows by this time, an almost greater claim to importance
in the <cite>History of Criticism and Literary Taste</cite> than
his earlier directly critical work, and a much greater one than
the more abstract æsthetic inquiries of Breitinger even, still
more of Baumgarten and Sulzer and the rest. Taken with
these earlier inquiries they give him and his coadjutor a high
and most memorable place in the general story of the appreciation
of literature. He was certainly not a man of much—and
Breitinger does not seem to have been one of any—original
poetical power; he does not himself seem to have had even so
much as his colleague had of learning or acuteness: and both
were <span lang="de"><i>echt Deutsch</i></span> in their long-windedness and want of concinnity.
But they did what they could; and it turned out
that they had done a great deal.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.22'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The “Swiss-Saxon” quarrel.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the famous “Swiss-Saxon” quarrel<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> which followed the
publication of Breitinger’s <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Dichtkunst</cite></span> and Gottsched’s
denunciation thereof in a new edition of his own,
I shall, according to my previous practice, say little.
It has in all the books the usual disproportionate
prominence of such things, and its actual importance was even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>less than usual. A brief but good account of it, and of all the
underground jealousies and littlenesses that led up to it, may
be found in Braitmaier. These jealousies, especially the general
revolt against the sort of tyranny of letters which Gottsched’s
skilful management of his periodicals and his pedagogic temper
had instituted, were much more noticeable in it than any clear
classic-romantic “dependence.” But, <em>on the whole</em>, the revolt
against Gottsched was in the direction of revolt against at
least Neo-Classicism. By degrees, too, it branched out into an
attack on, and a defence of, two particular poets—Haller and
Klopstock; and though neither of these is very delectable “to
us,” both were distinctly in their time champions of the freedom
of the poetic Jerusalem. It was fought out in Gottsched’s
<span lang="de"><cite>Beiträge</cite></span> on his side, and in a kind of periodical entitled
<span lang="de"><cite>Sammlung Kritischer, poetischer, und geistvoller Schriften</cite></span>, which
Bodmer brought out in opposition,<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> in divers others,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and in
numerous pamphlets. The most important critics whom it
produced, and these indirectly for the most part, were the
elder Schlegels, especially the eldest, Johann Elias, who, from
a contributor, though never exactly a partisan, of Gottsched,
became one of the objects of his special indignation. Of others,
Schwabe, Cramer, Mylius, Pyra, we can but take note in passing
here. Gellert has been mentioned in the last volume.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span></div>
<a id='sec7.2.23'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The elder Schlegels: Johann Adolf.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If not every schoolboy, every one with the slightest tincture
of letters, is supposed to be aware that there were two persons
of the name of Schlegel, who are of very great
account in German and in European criticism.
Not merely the schoolboy, but the person ordinarily
tinged with letters, may perhaps be excused
if he does not know that at least<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> <em>four</em> of the name and family
have claim to rank here—Johann Elias, his younger brother
Johann Adolf, August Wilhelm, and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich,
these two last being sons of Johann Adolf. Of these the elder
pair concern us in this particular place. And of them it will
be most convenient to take Johann Adolf first, not for the
sake of his famous offspring, but because his critical work
is the less important. He took part in the obscure and uninteresting
squabble over the Pastoral school,<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> but his main
contribution to our subject is a translation, with notes and
elaborate <span lang="de"><cite>Abhandlungen</cite></span>, of Batteux. In this, published as
early as 1751, and reprinted later,<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> he is still an evidence of
the domination of French, which his more original brother at
least partly rejected. But there are signs and tokens. He
is constantly making respectful suggestions and limitations:
“This conclusion is too large,” “this is true <em>to a certain extent</em>,”
and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="de"><i>Abhandlungen</i></span> show the German tendency to generalisation
and abstract disquisition:—On the Origin of Arts, the
Building up of Taste, the divisions of Poetry, its foundation in
imitation or illusion, its distinction from History, and from
Ornate Prose, &#38;c. Schlegel is very much cumbered about
Kinds, insists that we must try each new kind and see
whether it comes naturally or not. If it does, that is right.
The Wonderful has “a natural right to please us, a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>founded in the constitution of our souls.” The soul demands
novelty, &#38;c. But like his part-master, Gottsched, he is very
doubtful about Ariosto and Milton (Death and Sin are such
“<em>shadowy</em> persons”!), and I do not think he mentions Shakespeare.
He has a considerable position in the list of writers
on German versification, a subject which was acquiring much
importance from the set against rhyme, mentioned above.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Johann Elias.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His elder brother, Johann Elias, is a much more original and
independent person. The very high claims made for him by
his editor, Herr von Antoniewicz,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and by Herr
Braitmaier, may require some deduction when we
consider his actual work; but not much. He died (1749) at
a little over thirty: and during this short life he had been a
diplomatist, a professor, a prolific and remarkable dramatist,
and a miscellaneous poet. So that he had not much time
to spare for criticism. But his work in it has that rare
quality, or combination of qualities, which we have noted
in Dryden, the quality of marking and learning the things
that a man reads and writes of, and correcting himself
by both processes. It is quite astonishing to read his
first critical work, a “Letter on Ancient and Modern
Tragedy,” and to note, though his actual standpoint is not
very advanced, the thoroughness and freshness of appreciation
shown by a boy of one-and-twenty, in the very
dawn and almost the twilight of the great period of German
literature. Other interesting papers lead to the still more
remarkable review of Borck’s prose translation of <cite>Julius
Cæsar</cite>, with its parallel between that play and the <span lang="de"><cite>Leo
Armenius</cite></span> of the German seventeenth-century dramatist,
Andreas Gryphius. There is, of course, a danger, if this be
uncritically read, of our failing to grasp Schlegel’s standpoint
in regard to both the subjects, and of the excellent Gryph
appearing to us too much in the light in which Shakespeare
himself appeared to Voltaire. Moreover, the German Alexandrine
is—even to an ear broken to a thousand measures in
half a dozen languages—one of the most disagreeable that can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>be found. But allow for all these things, as criticism demands,
and you will have a piece of appreciation such as (so far at
least as I know) had not appeared in German before, and one
of which, <span lang="la"><i>æquatis æquandis</i></span>, hardly any of the greatest English
or French critics since need have been ashamed in his
<span lang="de"><cite>Lehrjahre</cite></span>. The discussions of Imitation,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> which the lovers of
abstract criticism seem to regard as Schlegel’s greatest title to
fame, and which are certainly his largest, though very sound
and stimulating for their time, and not even obsolete in regard
to the “realist” and “naturalist” debates of the latest nineteenth
century, are a little scholastic in method. From reading
some estimates of Schlegel the student might almost be prepared
to find in him a promulgation of one of the last secrets of
criticism, the discovery that not only need you not always
realise but you nearly always must <em>dis</em>realise—give the things
as they are <em>not</em> in nature; and that by no means merely to
suppress uglinesses and the like. So far as this I do not think
he gets anywhere,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> but he gets pretty far: and his argument
was most valuable at the time when Gottsched was priding
himself on having once more based Poetic on a rigid Imitation-principle.
But some of the best of Schlegel’s work is to be
found in the last example of it, the <span lang="de">“Gedanken zur Aufnahme
des Dänischen Theaters,”</span> where the good and bad points of
both English and French drama, and the imitation or avoidance
which they deserve accordingly, are set forth with an insight,
a range, and a power of appreciation which do not come much
behind Lessing, not to mention an impartiality which Lessing
by no means always shows. In the Shakespeare-and-Gryph parallel
Johann Elias had practically founded German Shakespeare-study,
and in this piece he takes the line necessary to prevent
a too one-sided pursuit of it. His actual critical achievement
is not, and could not be, large; but it is precious in itself, and
it shows that, had he lived, there was almost nothing at all
possible in his time that he might not have done in criticism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>You could trust him, I think, on the English novel, and you
could trust him on German and mediæval poetry, with the
certainty that, in the long-run at any rate, he would come</p>

<p class='c001'>right.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.25'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Moses Mendelssohn.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the praiseworthy industry of Nicolai we have spoken in
the last volume: and the only critic whom it is necessary to
mention in any detail before passing to Lessing, who
is himself in a way the critical sum and substance
as well as the crown and flower of this period—Moses Mendelssohn—belongs
rather to the æstheticians pure and simple.
He did, however, much solid actual critical work, to a great
extent in collaboration with both of the persons just mentioned.
Those who are curious about him may consult the very extensive
(indeed, I fear it must rather be called the disproportionately
extensive) notice of him by Herr Braitmaier, who gives
this learned Jew some two-thirds of his second volume, and
not much less than one-third of his whole book. Mendelssohn,
however, is really an important person in the history of German
criticism, and probably counted for something in the development
of Lessing, who was his intimate friend. He seems to
have had little tincture of classical literature, but was intensely
interested in modern; and was for some twenty years
a constant reviewer of it. He inclines somewhat to the
moral rather than to the purely literary judgment in his notices
of English writers, even of Shakespeare, much more of Young
and Richardson, and he was not disposed to accept the Wartonian
view of Pope. Indeed, with all his merits he seems to
me to be further “below proof,” from the literary point of
view, not merely than Lessing but than J. E. Schlegel. The
actual critical work<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> of this Moses, as shown in his collected
writings, leaves us, if not in the depths of the wilderness, at
any rate at some distance from the Promised Land. There is
a certain amount of criticism in his <cite>Letters</cite>, and he illustrates
eighteenth-century tendencies by writing on <span lang="de"><cite>Das Erhabene und
das Naïve</cite></span>. His general drift is very frankly displayed in the
epistles of Aristes to Hylas, on “How the Young should read
Old and New Poetry,” where Plutarch’s title<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> is not more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>closely followed than his spirit. The treatise, though in no
way contemptible, is one of those which have been described
(no doubt by a reminiscence of Hobbes) as “all <span lang="de"><i>-keit</i></span> and <span lang="de"><i>-lung</i></span>.”
And Mendelssohn’s attitude to criticism could not be better
indicated than in the following sentence:<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> “We laugh at
Regnard’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Le Joueur</cite></span> and avoid being called gamblers; we weep
over the English <cite>Gamester</cite> and are ashamed to be such.” Perhaps
so; perhaps also not. But the symptoms, if existent, are
quite compatible with the existence of any degree of literary
merit in either case, if not also with the existence of none.</p>

<p class='c001'>Baumgarten, Sulzer, and some others must be relegated to the
Æsthetic pound.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.26'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Lessing.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The general reputations which are wholly or mainly founded
on criticism are so few that it behoves the historian thereof
to approach them with unusual circumspection, to
“put on the inquirer’s holy robe and a purged
considerate mind,” as Mr Arnold says. There is the obvious
danger of merely indorsing the general opinion in a tame and
banal assentation; and there is the not much less obvious
(and perhaps not a little greater) danger of succumbing to the
temptation of “saying something different”—of aiming at a
cheap distinction by paradox or eccentricity. Perhaps it is
even easier to escape these dangers in reality than to seem to
escape them: more particularly in the case of Lessing, of whom,
in England at least, almost every educated person knows that
he was a great critic, while only specialists know much more.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.27'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Some cautions respecting him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That he was a great critic nobody can deny: but it is perhaps
desirable to warn those who come to him knowing something
of literary criticism already, and  expecting great
things in it from him, that they should not raise
their expectations too high, and that they should
thoroughly master certain preliminary facts. The
most important of these is that Lessing’s interests were not,
as the interests of very great critics almost invariably have
been, either wholly literary, or literary first of all, or, as in
Aristotle’s case, as literary as possible. As it was said of
Clarissa that “there is always something that she prefers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the truth,” so there is nearly always something that Lessing
prefers to literature, constantly as he was occupied with books.
Now it is the theatre;<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> now it is art—especially art viewed from
the side of archæology; now it is classical scholarship of the
minuter kind; now philosophy or theology; now it is morals;
not unfrequently it is more, or fewer, or all of these things
together, which engage his attention while literature is left out
in the cold.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.28'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>His moral obsession; on</i> Soliman the Second.</div>

<p class='c001'>The most curious instance of his moral preoccupation (which,
as the commonest and that with which we are most familiar,
we may get rid of  first) has  reference<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a> to  Marmontel’s
<span lang="fr"><i>conte</i></span> of <cite>Soliman the Second</cite>.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Lessing rather
liked Marmontel, who had been civil to <cite>Miss Sara
Sampson</cite>, I think, and whom he somewhere couples
with Diderot, thereby showing that he at any rate was able to
distinguish in the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Eléments de Littérature</cite></span> something
very different from a <span lang="fr"><i>perruque</i></span>. He admits “the wit, the
knowledge of the world, the elegance, the grace” of this “excellent
and delightful” tale. But he is fearfully disturbed at its
morality. The Sultan, it seems, is “a satiated libertine”; [but
would not Rymer be for once justified in urging this as “a
character worn by them in all ages of the world” in which
there were Sultans?] Roxelane is “a baggage which gets its
way.” [Undoubtedly: but do not baggages as a rule get theirs?]
Lessing, however, cannot away with “the thing,” as he calls
the owner of the <span lang="fr"><i>petit nez retroussé</i></span>. What a wretched part is
the great Soliman made to play! He and Roxelane “belong
neither to the actual world, nor to a world in which cause and
effect follow a different order, but to the general effect of good.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“The Turk only knows sensual love” [Rymer! Rymer!]. Lessing
is afraid that the <span lang="fr"><i>lune rousse</i></span> will rise for Soliman on the very
morrow of his wedding: and that he will see in Roxelane
“nothing but her impudence and the <span lang="fr"><i>nez retroussé</i></span>.” [Now as
these were the very things that captivated him, it might rather
seem that all would be well.] In Soliman the instructive is
lacking. “We ought to despise both him and Roxelane; or
rather one [which one?] ought to disgust and the other to anger
us,” though, or perhaps more particularly, <em>because</em> “they are
painted in the most seductive colours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is really nothing to be said to this but ὦ πόποι! In
the first place, all this good moral indignation simply explodes
through the touch-hole. The tale is pure satire on the <em>actual</em>
weakness of man and triumph of woman—and this actuality
who dare deny? If Lessing does not think both Soliman and
Roxelane natural, so much the worse for Lessing. In the
second place, neither is in the least degree held up for our
admiration, though the skill of the artist may deserve that
admiration in almost the highest degree. We may, if we like,
pronounce Soliman a weak man and rather immoral ruler,
and suspect Roxelane (as he suspected her himself) of being
very little better than she should be. But not only does the
critic waste his powder in the direction in which he actually
fires; he loses the opportunity of bringing down excellent game.
He lets slip altogether (as Tassoni<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a> had <em>not</em> altogether, though
he did not follow it out) the chance of arguing that most important
and interesting critical question of the attraction of
the irregular, the unexpected, the capricious, the teasing. He
might have got “instruction” to his heart’s content, for us
and for himself, out of this shocking story of the great Sultan
and the <span lang="fr"><i>petit nez retroussé</i></span>. Surely it were better done thus
to profit by the curves of Roxelane’s countenance than to
read us a dull sermon on her want of moral rectitude? But
Lessing does not think so—master though he be, at least
according to German notions, of that very irony which should
have kept him right.</p>

accumulated strokes which would in the sister art go
towards making, if they would not completely make, a most
attractive <em>picture</em>, produce very little definite effect as a

<p class='c009'>Here of course the charm arises from the fact that the image
is <em>new</em>, personal—that is to say, that it is <em>literary</em>. The curves
of the wind-engrailed surge on the sand are not Vida’s “stealings,”
they are originals—whoso takes them will not make

They are like the “chrysoprase” eyes of Clarimonde in Gautier’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Morte Amoureuse</cite></span>, which make that piece immortal. The man
who <em>now</em> gives us eyes of chrysoprase might as well make them
gooseberries. Lessing does not say this, does not hint it: indeed
(as Lamb’s Scotchman would point out) it would have
been, in reference to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Morte Amoureuse</cite></span>, impossible for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to do so. But he is on the way to saying it, and he instigates

<a id='sec7.2.32'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Lessing’s Gallophobia</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The truth is that in reading the <span lang="de"><cite>Dramaturgie</cite></span><a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a> one cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>help remembering Carlyle’s capital complaint of Voltaire that
“to him the Universe was one larger patrimony of
St Peter from which it were good and pleasant to
chase the Pope,” and regretting that Lessing should have
thought it necessary to substitute Voltaire himself for the
Holy Father. It was inevitable perhaps and necessary for the
time: but the result is tedious. And unfortunately this
Gallophobia in general, this Corneliophobia and Voltairiophobia
in particular, affects, and very unfavourably affects, those rectifications
and reconstructions of Aristotle which have given
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Dramaturgie</cite></span> its great reputation. With all his talent, all
his freshness, Lessing is to a very great extent merely varying
the Addisonian error—and indeed, as with all these early
German critics, Addison himself had too great an influence on
him. As Addison had wasted his powers on showing that
Milton, whom the pseudo-Aristotelians had decried, was very
Aristotelian, or at least Homeric, after all, so Lessing devotes
a most unnecessary amount of energy to showing that the
pseudo-Aristotelians themselves were not Aristotelian at all.
It was true; it was in a sense well worth doing; but there was
so much else to do! There is a famous passage at the beginning
of No. 7 which itself really annihilates the whole proceeding,
and laughs “boundary lines of criticism” out of court.
Nor is Lessing’s aberration a mere accidental one. It comes
from the fact that he had not cleared up his own mind on
some important parts of the question. He says, for instance,
in his criticism of <span lang="fr"><cite>Rodogune</cite></span> (No. 31, beginning), “The revenge
of an ambitious woman should never resemble that of a jealous
one.” <span lang="la"><i>Æternum vulnus!</i></span> What is “<em>the</em> revenge of <em>an</em> ambitious
woman?” “<em>the</em> revenge of <em>a</em> jealous one?” Show me the revenge
of your jealous Amaryllis, the revenge of your ambitious
Neæra; and <em>then</em> I will tell you whether they are right or not.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and typomania.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The fact is, that on what we may call the other side of his
virtue—to call it the defect of his quality would be rather to
beg the question—he is, after all, a preceptist with
some difference. Not merely is he an unflinching
and almost “right-or-wrong” Aristotelian, but from genuine
agreement of taste and judgment he still criticises almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>wholly by Kinds. It is <em>the</em> drama, <em>the</em> epic, <em>the</em> fable, <em>the</em> lyric,
<em>the</em> epigram that he makes for, across or sometimes almost outside
of the actual examples of their classes. And here, too,
we find that the more poetical divisions and the more poetical
aspects of these and others have no very special appeal to him.
He belittles Lyric altogether; if he is particularly fond of the
Fable in the special sense, it is because it also has a “fable”
in the general, it is an imitation of life, a criticism of it. His
attempt to prove that Horace had no looking-glasses in his
bedroom<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> is a pleasant pendant to his indignation with Roxalana’s
<span lang="fr"><i>minois chiffonné</i></span>: and though there is a great deal to be
said for Martial, Lessing<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a> is bribed to adopt the <span lang="la"><i>vita proba</i></span>
view rather by the Roman poet’s intense <em>vivacity</em> than by his
literary merit.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.34'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>His study of antiquity more than compensating.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet this, once more, is but “the other side of a virtue.”
The best authorities agree that to Lessing may be assigned absolutely
the return to, if not the very initiation of,<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
a direct, scholarly, intelligent, <em>literary</em> study of the
ancients themselves. As far as the Greek Theatre
itself is concerned, Brumoy had anticipated him:
far too little justice has often been done to the work of this
modest and solid scholar. But Brumoy’s outlook was wanting
in range. Lessing had in his mind, as well as Latin and Greek,
English,<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a> French and German always, Italian, even Spanish<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>to some extent. And he read the Latin and the Greek
in themselves—and with all due apparatus of technical
scholarship considering his time. He was as far from the
twice- and thrice-garbled sciolism of the average French, and
even English, critic of the late seventeenth and earlier eighteenth
century, as from the arid pedantry of the Dutch and
German scholars of the same date. To him, more perhaps
than to any one else, it is due that modern criticism has not
followed, more than it has done, the mere foolishness of the
“modern” advocates in the Quarrel—that it has fortified itself
with those sound and solid studies which antiquity alone can
supply. For once more let it be said that if, from the pure
critical point of view, Ancient without Modern is a stumbling-block,
Modern without Ancient is foolishness utter and
irremediable.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.35'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>And especially of Aristotle.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps Lessing’s greatest glory is that he has given answer
to the despairing question which his master quoted  in the
Ethics.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> “If the water chokes, what must one drink
on the top of it?” “More and purer water” is that
answer, of course: and Lessing scoured the clogged
and stagnant channels of Neo-Classicism by recurrence to the
original fount. Of course he was not himself absolutely
original. He owed something to Heinsius, in that most remarkable
tractate to which we did justice in its place, among the
more distant moderns, to Dacier, pedant as he is, to Brumoy,
to Hurd among the nearer. But more than to any of them he
devoted himself to the real text of the <cite>Poetics</cite>, interpreted by
a combination of scholarship and mother-wit. To this day he
has to be consulted upon the <span lang="la"><i>cruces</i></span> of Fable and Character, of
Unity, of knotting and unknotting, of <em>katharsis</em>.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> That he has
said no final word on them matters nothing: final words are
not to be said on things of opinion and probability</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But on these and not a few other matters he reorganised the
whole method and the whole tenor of the inquiry. And so he
not only earns his own place in the story, but half unintentionally
establishes, or helps us to establish, the great
truth that the whole <em>is</em> a story, a history, a chain of opinion
and comment on opinion, now going more, now less, right, but
to be kept as a chain.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.36'></a><div class='sidenote side8'><i>With whom he combines Diderot.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nothing can illustrate this better than the fact that Lessing’s
second master in criticism is—Diderot! He does not regard
that erratic and <em>cometic</em> genius as he regards Aristotle,
he does not think the <span lang="fr"><cite>Bijoux Indiscrets</cite></span>, and
the remarks on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Fils Naturel</cite></span>, and the rest, as
being “as infallible as the <cite>Elements of Euclid</cite>.”<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> He would
have disqualified himself from serious consideration if he had.
He dissents from some of Diderot’s opinions; he combats some
of his arguments. But he admits, almost in so many words,
and in a constant attitude which is more valuable than any
verbal admission, that this most irregular, revolutionary,
<em>casual</em> of modern thinkers has set him on his own path of
independent revaluation of critical principles.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.37'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>His deficiencies in regard to mediæval literature.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And we find confirmation of this in those of his critical
writings which have not yet been mentioned, as well as illustrations
of other critical characteristics in him. It
is curious that Lessing, so sensitive and receptive
to ancient and later modern influences, is almost as
proof against mediæval and (in his own language)
early modern as Gottsched himself. His low estimate of Lyric
seems to come partly from the fact that Aristotle had slighted
it, or at least passed it over, partly from the fact that in
relation to Germany he is not thinking of her ballads and
lays, not even of the extravagances of the seventeenth century,
but of the tame Anacreontic of Hagedorn, Gleim, and Company.
Even his study of Shakespeare has not set him right in this
respect. It is most curious to read his contemporary Hurd, a
contemporary for whom Lessing had a just respect, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>remember that Hurd could appreciate not merely both Aristotle
and Shakespeare, but both Horace and Spenser. And there
are few things which bring out more clearly that immense
debt to Shakespeare and Spenser themselves which has been
insisted on as due by English criticism. It was too early for
Lessing to have gone back to Gottfried and Walther;<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a> the
German Renaissance had nothing (save the ballads, which he
would not have) to offer him.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.38'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>The close of the</i> Dramaturgie <i>and its moral</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The greatest places of the <span lang="de"><cite>Dramaturgie</cite></span> are those at the close
of No. 95, and the penultimate passage of all. In the former,
after a long discussion of the Aristotelian commentaries
of Hurd and Dacier, he refashions his master’s
famous dictum in other matter, that “accuracy must
not be expected.” He is not, he says, “obliged to
solve all the problems he raises.” His thoughts may seem
desultory, or even contradictory: but it does not matter if they
supply others with the germ of individual thought. He would
but scatter “<span lang="la"><i>fermenta cognitionis</i></span>.” In the other, he proceeds
still farther, though still perhaps without a clear idea how far
the path itself will lead. Germans, he says (I shorten somewhat
here), had imitated the French because the French were
believed to be your only followers of the ancients. Then
English plays came in, an entirely different style of drama was
revealed, and the Germans concluded that the aim of tragedy
could be fulfilled without the French rules—that the rules
were wrong. And then they went on to object to rules
altogether as mere genius-hampering pedantry. “In short, we
had very nearly thrown away in wantonness all past experience,
insisting that the poet shall in every instance discover
the whole art for himself.” Lessing has endeavoured “to
arrest this secondary fermentation,” and that is all.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Invaluable words! and, if somewhat extra-literary,—or, from
another point of view, directed to too narrow a part of literature,—yet
in their true acceptation governing and guiding the
whole method, the entire campaign, of literary criticism.
Whether Lessing had taken any suggestion from Batteux,<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a> who
had written long before him, I do not know: but the different
attitude of the French critic and the German is most interesting,
and gives the reason why we have treated Batteux in the
last volume and are treating Lessing in this. Both writers
perceive, each in his own fashion, that every work of genius is,
or at any rate contains, a rule. I do not even know that it
can be denied that Lessing, almost as much as Batteux, though
under happier stars, has an idea of working out one general
rule of all the particulars—a process which is but too likely
to lead back again into the House of Bondage; but his actual
notion takes a far more catholic form, leads far more directly
to the way of salvation. You must study each work of genius
in order to get its contribution to the Inner Rule, the highest
formula. And if you do this all will be well. It is not the
Rule—as some falsely hold, and as perhaps some even have
falsely thought that the present writer holds—that does the
harm, but its exclusive and disfranchising application <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>—not
even the Kind, but its elevation into a caste, with the
correlative institution of pariahdom. And Lessing’s principle
of never neglecting study of former experience saves this
danger at once.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.39'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Miscellaneous specimens of his criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But the twenty volumes of Lessing’s Works, or rather the
round dozen, more or less, of them which contain or concern
criticism, are not to be passed over without some
more detailed mention. The first contains (besides
the early and not uninteresting Preface to his collected
<cite>Poems</cite> in 1753) the famous Dissertations on the Fable,
which, whether one agrees or not with them, give an admirable
example of the thoroughness, the sense, and the scholarship of
Lessing’s critical method. He lays out the history of opinion
on his subject from Aristotle and Aphthonius to Breitinger and
Batteux; he combats, not long-windedly but scientifically, those
opinions with which he disagrees; he sets forth his own with
such further disposition of the subject as he thinks proper.
And in sixty pages he has given as masterly an example of
“criticism on a <em>kind</em>,” of general criticism (for we must maintain
the reservations above outlined), as need be desired—an
example uniting antique clearness and proportion, scholastic
method, and modern vivacity and illustrative variety. A somewhat
different kind of document, but the kind which we have
so often looked for in vain hitherto, is given by the great mass
of reviews, literary letters, the rhetorical discussions of various
kinds, and the like, which fill four successive volumes.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a> From
the very first, written when Lessing was but two-and-twenty,
his scholarship, his reading, and his formidable and rather
aggressive intellectual ability, appear unmistakably. Much
is mere abstract, but more independent work appears from
the long and early criticism of the <span lang="it"><cite>Captivi</cite></span><a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a> to the review

and heterogeneous subjects and persons, from Rousseau’s Dijon
Discourse through Klopstock and Piron, Bodmer’s sacred epics

the tone of mischievous reviewing early; “too much! too much

glanced at above. The opening <span lang="de">“Vademecum für Lange,”</span> a
vitriolic and practically destructive retort on that blundering
translator of Horace himself, who had not had the sense
to sit down quietly under a severe but not offensive review
of Lessing’s, is one of the capital examples of its kind—a
kind questionable but sometimes to be allowed. The <span lang="de">“Anmerkungen
über das Epigramm,”</span> the principal single constituent
of the volume,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a> are very noteworthy. The rest consist mainly
of textual and other animadversions of the kind which we
reluctantly leave out here from the Renaissance downward.
The chief are on Paulus Silentiarius, and on that interesting
book the fables of the so-called <cite>Anonymus Neveleti</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>He returns to this in one<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a> of the numerous papers of vol.
xvi., another collection of notes, notices (some of Old German
Literature), and reviews, the last mostly very short and sometimes
a little perfunctory. What might have been the most,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and is not the least, interesting of these,<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a> has for subject a
German translation of the first two volumes of <cite>The Rambler</cite> in
1754. Lessing does not name Johnson, nor does he seem to
know anything about him; but he praises the Essays highly.
Now, if you could have combined the good points of these two,
and “sprinkled in,” as Mambrun might say,<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a> a little <span lang="la"><i>furor
romanticus</i></span>, it would have been difficult to get a better critical
mixture than the result.</p>

<p class='c001'>The still further collection of critical miscellanea in vol. xix.
is mostly philosophical or, according to Lessing’s unfortunate
later habit, theological in character,<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a> but the long <span lang="la"><span lang="de">“Pope als
Metaphysiker”</span></span> deserves mention as at least partially literary
and as more than partially good. Finally, the numerous and
not seldom interesting notes or motes of the <span lang="de"><cite>Kollectaneen</cite></span> or
Commonplace Book published after Lessing’s death, though
they frequently approach or flit round strictly literary criticism,
never, I think, actually constitute it.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.40'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>His attitude to Æschylus and Aristophanes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the case of so great a name occupying the most prominent
position at the last turning-point of the recorded critical course,
it is necessary to insist on  those reserves which
have been made already. Everybody who has read
Lessing carefully must have noticed, whether with
immediate understanding of the reason or not, the
very small attention which he pays to two writers in his own
favourite department, whom some would call the very greatest
in it, as far as Greece is concerned, and to whom hardly any
nowadays would deny a place among the greatest of Greece or
of the world—that is to say, Æschylus and Aristophanes. His
defenders are prompt with an excuse at least as damaging as
most excuses. People did not, says Lessing’s very able and
very erudite commentator, M. Kont, fully understand in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>days the importance of Æschylus in connection with Greek
myths: and the forms of drama which he, and still more
Aristophanes, adopted were unsuitable to that modern use and
application which Lessing always had at heart. Alas! the
value of an author in connection with Greek myths is so
exceedingly indifferent to literature! and his value as helping
to fill a stage at the present day is also of so very little importance!
If ignorance of one of these things and consciousness
of the absence of the other determined Lessing’s neglect
of the greatest tragic poet of Greece,—of the greatest comic
poet, except Shakespeare, of the world,—then it will be but
too clear that whatever Lessing cared most for, it was not
poetry,—that his care for poetry as such—nay, for literature
as such—was even rather small. To call him a “king of
criticism” is foolish, because that is just what he is not. He
is grand-duke of not a few critical provinces which, somehow
or other, he never can consolidate into a universal monarchy
of critical wit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me, however, assure any of my readers who are apt to
regard as “unfriendly” or “unsympathetic” criticism which is
not eulogy thick and slab, neat and unmixed, that there is no
intention here of belittling Lessing’s critical qualities,<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a> only one
of indicating critically what they were and what they were not.
The gift of critical expression he most certainly had in a very
high degree. His exposition is masterly: though he is constantly,
as has been said, leading the discussion aside from
concrete to abstract, and from particular to general points, he
is scarcely ever obscure, confused, or vague. His language is
precise, without being technical or jargonish. He has something
of the German lack of urbanity, but he often has a
felicity of expression that is French rather than German, with
depth and humour which are far more German than French.
Never has one of the tricks of the critical pedant—common to
the kind in our day as in his—been so happily described as
in the opening of <span lang="de"><cite>Wie die Alten den Tod gebildeten</cite></span>: “Herr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Klotz always thinks he is at my heels. But when I look
back at his yelp, I see him lost in a cloud of dust quite
astray from the road I have trodden.”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The unlucky distraction
of his later years, to theological or anti-theological
squabbling may—nay, must—have lost us much. But as it
is, he never fails for long together to give those <span lang="la"><i>fermenta
cognitionis</i></span> of which he speaks. He is always “for thoughts”:
that fecundity, as a result of the critical congress, which
we shall remark in his part-master Diderot, is everywhere
present in him.</p>

<a id='sec7.2.41'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Frederic the Great.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Lessing, whom the king neglected, may suggest Frederic the
Great, whose <span lang="fr"><cite>De la Littérature Allemande</cite></span> (1780) the Germans
have most forgivingly translated into the language
despised by the writer, and adopted as a “monument”
of its literature.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a> It is certainly a monument of a
kind, and the most striking contrast possible to Lessing’s
work. I shall not say that it shows, as a Carlylian not less
fervent than myself<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a> has admitted of Frederic’s historian on
Marryat, that Frederic “was stupid for once in his life.” But
it certainly shows that he could be absurdly narrow and perverse,
and could push the confidence of ignorance to a wonderful
length. That Frederic <em>was</em> very ignorant of literature there is
no doubt. It is known that he “had small Latin<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a> and <em>no</em>
Greek”; his expressions about English, the language and the
literature, in this very tractatule, are, if possible, more impudently
ignorant than those about German: he does not, I
think, so much as name a Spanish author; and his references
to Italian might have been, and probably were, derived from
mere hearsay.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this was a good preparation for judging a literature in
the very peculiar state of German in 1780, when, to do it
justice, a man should have had the knowledge, then almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>impossible, of the various periods from “Middle High” onwards,
the power to appreciate its very different phases,
which few had, and the power, which hardly anybody ever
has, of appreciating the literary present, and even future. But
Frederic need not have made so near an approach to stupidity
as he makes here.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.2.42'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><span lang="fr">De la Littérature Allemande.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>That there is considerable truth and shrewdness in the king’s
censure of his subjects’ pedantry and want of taste is quite
certain; that the German language was in a less
favourable condition for literature than any other
of the great European languages is certain also.
Many of his practical precepts are as sensible as we should
expect from a man so great in affairs. But his literary
criticism is rather worse than we should expect even from a
disciple of Voltaire, whose pet prejudices they not merely
reflect but exaggerate. Of all the “answers” (a most interesting
list of which, with account of them where possible, from
that one of Goethe’s, which has the here most deplorable
“defect of being lost,” downwards, will be found in Herr
Geiger’s Introduction) the happiest is in three words of
Herder’s, which describe the treatise as “<span lang="de"><i>ein comisches Meisterstück</i></span>.”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
Frederic attributes to Horace, and in the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars
Poetica</cite></span> too, four words<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> which do not occur there, which
would not be very easy to get into the metre without destroying
their juxtaposition, and which it would be not much easier
to adjust to any context of the actual piece. He attributes to
Aristotle not merely the Three Unities, but instead of the
“Unity of <em>Action</em>” the “Unity of <em>Interest</em>,” thus handing over</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the whole position to the anti-Aristotelians after a fashion
which, if one of the king’s own generals had imitated it in
actual war, would have “broken” him for life, if it had not
put him against a wall, and opposite to a file of grenadiers. He
thinks that Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius wrote in Latin;
that Toland wrote the <em>Leviathan</em>; that Marot, Rabelais, and
Montaigne wrote a jargon at least as bad as any German—“gross
and destitute of grace.” In the most celebrated  passage<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a>—perhaps
the only one generally known—he not only out-Voltaires
Voltaire by speaking of the “abominable pieces of
Shakespeare,” those absurd “farces worthy of Canadian
savages,” but stigmatises <span lang="de"><cite>Goetz von Berlichingen</cite></span> as a “detestable
imitation” of them. He hardly knows of any other German
writers, and of those whom he praises Gellert and Gessner are
the only ones who have retained the least reputation. If for
one thing that he did—the injunction to write in German and
not take refuge in other languages—one is tempted to spare
him, the merit almost disappears when one remembers that he
meant the German to be written in the teeth of the natural
bent of the language. The bulk of his positive directions
has nothing to do with literature whatsoever, but with the
teaching of physical science, of law, &#38;c. And the real apex of
the <span lang="de"><i>comisches Meisterstück</i></span> (for Herder’s words are too good not
to be repeated) is to be found at the end. He prophesies, and
(such is the unending and unfathomable irony of Fate!) he prophesies
quite truly, that “the palmy days of our Literature have
not come, but they are approaching,” that he is their harbinger,
that they are just about to appear, “that though he shall not
see them, his age making it hopeless, he, like Moses, sees the
Promised Land, but must not enter it.” The inevitable jests
at Moses himself, and the bare “rocks of sterile Idumea,” follow.
But it was Moses who laughed last. Every word of Frederic’s
prophecy came true;  but it was because Germany neglected
every item of Frederic’s prescription. The palmy days did
come: they lasted for fifty glorious years and (with Heine)
longer. But their light was the light borrowed from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>abominable Shakespeare, and their leader was the author of
<span lang="de"><cite>Goetz von Berlichingen</cite></span>.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. For the special subjects of the
present chapter, putting Lessing, and
even him not wholly, out of the question,
there exists a remarkably “in-going”
monograph, Herr Friedrich
Braitmaier’s <span lang="de"><cite>Geschichte der Poetischen
Theorie und Kritik von den Diskursen
der Maler bis auf Lessing</cite></span> (Frauenfeld,
1889). This book has been of great
use to me; and I do not think that
any one can read it without respect for
the author’s learning, his good sense,
and the clearness and definiteness of
his report. His <span lang="fr"><i>compte-rendu</i></span> of particular
authors is often larger than it
need be for a fair first view; while
neither it nor anything else can ever
dispense the thorough student from
going to originals; and he might be
here and there less polemical. But
these things will not displease some
readers, and certainly they do not
spoil the book, which, however, be
it observed, is deplorably in want of
an index. With it should be taken
the extremely full and informing introduction—almost
a book in itself—of
Herr Johann von Antoniewicz to

below. For almost all my German

This book is “choke-full” of information

possible faults that Momus himself
could find with it are—first, that the
author sometimes digresses somewhat
from his path, which is itself so little
trodden that one would like him to
stick to it; and, secondly, that his
dealings with his subject might be
rather clearer and more methodic in
the text, and, being what they are, are
all the more in want of a clear and
methodic table of contents. But I am
too much indebted to him to quarrel.</p>

he winds up: “That the English
stage helps in such a shameless fashion
to nourish the two principal vices of
the English people—cruelty and lust—is
something so horrible that all
honour-loving Englishmen must blush
as often as they think of their theatre.
There is scarcely a comedy wherein
blood and murder do not come in
just as if it were a tragedy, and
wherein both sexes do not openly, and
with the most revolting expressions,
speak of things that can only occur
in disreputable and forbidden houses.”

<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. Gellert, who was a sort of
“prefect” for his time in this school
of modern German literature, gave at
least one proof of practical wisdom
which few men of letters have
equalled. Frederic the Great sent for
him, poured oil over him from his
beard to the skirts of his clothing,
and invited him again. Gellert did
not go. As for the others, Christian
Mylius, dying young, had the further
good luck to be a friend of Lessing,
who edited his <span lang="de"><cite>Vermischte Schriften</cite></span>
(Berlin, 1754). They run from
Theology to Vivisection. The chief
critical piece is a tractate (1743),
<span lang="de"><cite>Von den Reimen und dem Sylbenmasse

rhyme both in Tragedy and in
Comedy.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. Some of the original dates of Lessing’s
works may be usefully grouped
in a note: Early critical work, 1750
onwards; <span lang="de"><cite>Abhandlungen über die
Fabeln</cite></span>, 1759; <span lang="de"><cite>Laocoön</cite></span>, 1766; <span lang="de"><cite>Hamb.
Dramaturgie</cite></span>, 1767-68; <span lang="de"><cite>Anmerkungen
über das Epigramm</cite></span>, 1771. But the
whole thirty years of his literary life—at
least until his unlucky attack of
anti-theological mania towards its
close—were fruitful in criticism.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. This important and edifying problem
has attracted much attention
from scholars. M. Kont, the author of
a really admirable monograph on
<span lang="fr"><cite>Lessing et l’Antiquité</cite></span> (2 vols., Paris,
1894-9), devotes almost an excursus to
it. The original may be found in vol.
15 of Herr Göring’s (the collected)
ed., and it is fair to say that the latter
part of Lessing’s dissertation does much
to save the earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r64'>64</a>. Again see M. Kont for comment
and the <span lang="de">“Anmerkungen über das
Epigramm,”</span> <cite>Works</cite>, xv. 73 <i>sq.</i> for
text. Lessing also proclaimed his admiration
for Martial in his preface to
the early collection of his writings, in
1753.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. The not uncommon ascription
even of this is a result of that unjust
neglect or depreciation of Scaliger
and Castelvetro and the other Italians,
which we have attempted <span lang="la"><i>pro viribus</i></span>
to repair.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r66'>66</a>. Lessing’s curiosity as to at least
the English Drama was so insatiable
that he actually translated part of
Crisp’s (Fanny Burney’s “Daddy”
Crisp’s) <cite>Virginia</cite>—that play, the
doleful effects of whose failure or
doubtful success Macaulay, according
to Mrs Ellis, so much exaggerated.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f67'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. That he knows and quotes the
<span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo</cite></span> is much more surprising
than that he does not fully comprehend
Lope’s position.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f68'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. <cite>Eth. Nic.</cite>, VII. ii. 10.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f69'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. I wish that M. Kont had not fallen
into a common error by saying that
Bernays has “proved” Lessing’s interpretation
wrong in part. When
will people learn, in critical discussion,
to see that to “make a thing probable”
is not to “prove” it?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. Apparently Lessing would not
have disagreed much with the reactionary
modern who said that “the
only really valuable articles in the
present English school curriculum are
Greek and Euclid.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f71'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. Not that he did not pay some
attention to Old German: but it had
little effect on him, and he was
evidently fonder of the fifteenth century
than of the thirteenth.  Nor is
what has been said above to be taken
as meaning that Gottsched himself
neglected mediæval writers. On the
contrary, he studied them very carefully
as a part of his general patriotic
“Germanism.” Only he did not in the
least feel their drift.  Opinions on
Lessing’s own attitude to mediæval
literature differ remarkably, but I
cannot see much real appreciation in
it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. <i>V. sup.</i>, <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/73128/pg73128-images.html#Page_523'>vol. ii. p. 523</a>. As we
have seen, J. A. Schlegel had translated
the Frenchman when Lessing was
barely of age.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. To illustrate this before going
further, we may take account both of
the <cite>Theatrical Miscellanies</cite>, which fill
vols. vii. and viii. of the <cite>Works</cite>, and
of the similar miscellanies of a more
general kind contained in vol. xiv.
The latter include many short reviews
and notes of the kind elsewhere
noticed: the former supply by far the
most remarkable instance of that
extraordinary <em>industry</em>—that mania,
so to speak, for assimilating all the
material furnished by older and more
accomplished literatures—which is the
great note of this period of German
culture. Much, as was almost necessary,
is mere abstract, such as in
vol. 7 the above-noticed analysis of
Crisp’s <cite>Virginia</cite> and the long article
on the Tragedies of Seneca, where, however,
there is not a little actual criticism
of Brumoy, &#38;c. The <cite>Lives</cite> of Thomson
(“Jacob” Thomson) and of Destouches
show us by contrast what a great
thing Dr Johnson did in elaborating
the biographical-critical <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>: and
even the <cite>Dissertations</cite> on <span lang="fr"><i>tragédie
larmoyante</i></span> give little more than a
frame of Lessing’s, the painters being
Chassiron and Gellert. One article in
vol. 8, “Von Johann Dryden,” might
have been of the very highest critical
interest; but it is a mere fragment.
And the “Outlines of a History of
the English Stage,” though  showing
Lessing’s astonishing scholarship in his
favourite subject, are only outlines.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. vi.-ix. of the edition cited.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. This occupies more than fifty pages
(91-145) of vol. vi.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. Lessing is less tolerant in this case
than in that of Martial. The fact is
that, in spite of its outrageousness, the
libel would  be  rather  amusing  if  it
were not so exceedingly <em>tautologous</em>—with
the tautology of a certain class of
<span lang="it"><i>graffiti</i></span>.</p>

suppose <span lang="de"><cite>Der Schlenderer</cite></span> would have
been not “noble” enough. Lessing’s
English does not seem to have been
very idiomatic, for he says that the
word “Rambler” means properly “a
landlooper who has no regular abiding-place.”</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f84'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r84'>84</a>. It is curious that three great critics
of the three great literary countries of
modern Europe, Lessing, Sainte-Beuve,
and Mr Arnold, should all have forgotten
in their later years, the caution,
“Be not critical <em>overmuch</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. I most particularly, for instance,
do <em>not</em> wish to seem of the mind of
an American Professor who announces
in a periodical as I revise this book
that he believes he has “overthrown
most of Lessing’s ideas” in the <span lang="de"><cite>Laocoön</cite></span>,
“shown that his statements about
Homer are wrong, his psychology
wrong, and his reasoning often fallacious.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. Lessing did not always keep so

is, of course, an example of
pure ignorance, as is the general objection
to the consecrated phrase and
figure of the “finger of time” and
its ring. But “arms” generally have

<p class='c001'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. By an accident not worth dilating
upon I was unable to incorporate the
results of careful reading of König and
Conti in the text. The former’s treatise
on Taste is very respectable for its
time, and must then have been quite
stimulating; but it belongs to the obsolete
box of our matter. Taste, excellent
in the palmy times of Greek
literature, declined later, was revived
by the Romans, lost in the Middle
Ages, recovered at the Renaissance,
lost again and recovered by the French,
and so on. He is much cumbered (as
some other excellent persons have
been) about the origin of the <em>word</em>
Taste—deprives the Spaniards of the
honour of inventing it, and very properly
finds its origin in Græco-Roman
times. It must be natural, but can
be improved by acquirement. It is
more <em>immediate</em> than judgment. It
extends to quite trivial things—snuff,
wine, foppery in dress, sensual pleasures,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conti’s work, in the edition quoted,
has the great drawback of being presented
almost wholly, as far as the
critical part of it is concerned, in abstracts
made from MS. by the editor.
It consists, besides Letters to the
Doge Marco Foscarini, to Maffei, to
Muratori, &#38;c., of Treatises on “Imitation,”
“Poetic Fantasy,” and the like
and of animadversions on classical and
Italian Poetry, on Fracastoro, on Gravina,
and others. It does not come to

<p class='c007'>We have already, in the last volume, seen that in England, about
the middle of the eighteenth century, the tables of criticism
turned, and that a company of critics, not large, not as a rule
very great men of letters, began slowly, tentatively, with a
great deal of rawness, and blindness, and even backsliding, to
grope for a catholic and free theory of literature, and especially
of poetry. We are now to examine this group<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a> more narrowly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>With the not quite certainly to be allowed exception of Gray,
no one of them could pretend to the first rank in the literature
of the time; and most of them (Hurd and Percy were the
chief exceptions) did not live to see, even at the extreme verge
of life, the advent of the champions who were to carry their
principles into practice. But they were the harbingers of the
dawn, little as in some cases (perhaps in all) they comprehended
the light that faintly and fitfully illuminated them
beforehand.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The first group.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Three of the writers of this class whom it is necessary to
name here have been alluded to already; the others were
Shenstone and the Wartons. As so often happens
in similar cases, it is exceedingly difficult to
assign exact priority, for mere dates of publication
are always misleading; and in this case, from their
close juxtaposition, they almost of themselves give the warning
that they are not to be trusted. How early, in his
indolent industry at Cambridge, Gray had come to a Pisgah-sight
of the true course of English poetry; Shenstone, in
pottering and maundering at the Leasowes, to glimpses of
the same; Percy and Shenstone again to their design, afterwards
executed by Percy alone, of publishing the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span>; the
Wartons to their revolutionary views of Pope on the one side
and Spenser on the other; Hurd to his curious mixture of
true and false <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>;—it is really impossible to say. The
last-named, judging all his work together, may seem the least
likely, early as some of that work is, to have struck out a distinctly
original way for himself; but all, no doubt, were really
driven, <span lang="la"><i>nolentes volentes</i></span>, conscious or unconscious, by the Time-Spirit.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.2'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Mediæval reaction.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The process which the Spirit employed for effecting this
great change was a simple one; indeed, we have almost summed
up his inspiration in the oracular admonition,
<span lang="la"><i>Antiquam exquirite matrem</i></span>. For more than two
hundred years literary criticism had been insolently
or ignorantly neglecting its mother, the Middle Age—now
with a tacit assumption that this period <em>ought</em> to be neglected,
now with an open and expressed scorn of it. But, as usually
happens, a return had begun to be made just when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>opposite progress seemed to have reached its highest point.
Dryden himself had “translated” and warmly praised
Chaucer; Addison had patronised <cite>Chevy Chase</cite>. But before
the death of Pope much larger and more audacious explorations
had been attempted. In Scotland—whether consciously
stung or not by the disgrace of a century almost barren of
literature—Watson the printer<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> and Allan Ramsay<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> had, in
1706-11 and 1724-40, unearthed a good deal of old poetry.
In England the anonymous compiler<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a> of the <cite>Ballads</cite> of 1723
had done something, and Oldys the antiquary, under the
shelter of “Mrs Cooper’s” petticoat, had done more with the
<cite>Muses’ Library</cite> of 1737. These examples<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a> were followed out,
not without a little cheap contempt from those who would
be in the fashion, and knew not that this fashion had received
warning. But they <em>were</em> followed, and their most remarkable
result, in criticism and creation combined, is the work of
Gray.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.3'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Gray </i></div>

<p class='c001'>We have not so very many fairer figures in our “fair” herd
than Gray, though the fairness may be somewhat like that of
Crispa,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a> visible chiefly to a lover of criticism itself.
His actual critical performance is, in proportion,
scantier even than his poetical; and the scantiness may at
first sight seem even stranger, since a man can but poetise
when he can, but may, if he has the critical faculty,
criticise almost when he will and has the opportunity. That
opportunity (again at first sight) Gray may seem to have
had, as scarcely another man in our whole long history
has had it. He had nothing else to do, and was not
inclined to do anything else. He had sufficient means,
no professional avocations, the knowledge, the circumstances,
the <span lang="fr"><i>locale</i></span>, the wits, the taste, even the velleity—everything
but, in the full sense, the will. This indeed he might, in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>circumstances and at all times, have lacked, for Mr Arnold
showed himself no philosophic student of humanity when he
said that at the date of Milton, or at the date of Keats, Gray
would have been a different man. His <em>work</em> would doubtless
have been a different work; but that is another matter. At
all times, probably, Gray would have had the same fastidiousness,
the same liability to be “put off”; and if his preliminary
difficulties had been lightened by the provision, in times nearer
our own, of the necessary rough-hewing and first research by
others, yet this very provision would probably have prevented
him from pursuing what he would have disdainfully regarded
as a second-hand business. We may—we must—regret that
he never finished that <cite>History of English Poetry</cite> which he
hardly began, that he never attempted the half-dozen other
things of the kind, which he was better equipped for doing
than any man then living, and than all but three or four men
who have lived since. But the regret must be tempered by a
secret consciousness that on the whole he probably would <em>not</em>
have done them, let time and chance and circumstance have
favoured him never so lavishly.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.4'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Peculiarity of his critical position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet this very idiosyncrasy of limitation and hamper in him
made, in a sense, for criticism; inasmuch as there are two
kinds of critical temperament, neither of which
could be spared. There is the eager, strenuous,
almost headlong critical disposition of a Dryden,
which races like a conflagration<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a> over all the field
it can cover; and there is the hesitating, ephectic, intermittent
temperament of a Gray, which directs an intense and all-dissolving,
but ill-maintained heat at this and that special part of
the subject. In what is called, and sometimes is, “originality,”
this latter temperament is perhaps the more fertile of the two,
and Gray has it in an almost astounding measure. Great as
was his own reading, a man might, I think, be as well read as
himself without discovering any real indebtedness of his, except
to a certain general influence of literary study in many
times and tongues. He knew indeed, directly or indirectly,
most of the other agents in the quiet and gradual revolution
which was coming on English poetic and literary taste; but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>was much in advance of all of them in time. Well as he was
read in Italian, he nowhere, I think, cites Gravina, in whom
there was something to put him on new tracks; and though
he was at least equally well read in French, and does cite Fontenelle,
it is not for any of the critical germs which we have
discovered in that elusive oracle. The one modern language
to which he seems to have paid little or no attention was
German,<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a> where the half-blind strugglings of the Zürich
school might have had some stimulus for him. Whatever he
did, alone he did it; and though the volume of his strictly
critical observations (not directed to mere common tutorial
scholarship) would, if printed consecutively, perhaps not fill
twenty—certainly not fifty—pages of this book, its virtue,
intrinsic and suggestive, surpasses that of libraries full of
Rapins and even of Batteux.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.5'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The Letters.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>From the very first these observations have, to us, no uncertain
sound. In a letter to West,<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a> when the  writer was
about  six-and-twenty, we find it stated with equal
dogmatism, truth, and independence of authority
that “the language of the age is never the language of poetry
except among the French, whose verse, where the thought or
image does not support it, differs nothing from prose,” with a
long and valuable citation, illustrating this defence of “poetic
diction,” and no doubt thereby arousing the wrath of
Wordsworth. Less developed, but equally important and
equally original, is the subsequent description of our language
as not being “a settled thing” like the French. Gray, indeed,
makes this with explicit reference only to the revival of
archaisms, which he defends; but, as we see from other places
as well as by natural deduction, it extends to reasonable
neologisms also. In this respect Gray is with all the best
original writers, from Chaucer and Langland downwards, but
against a respectably mistaken body of critics who would fain
not merely introduce the caste system into English, but, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Sir Boyle Roche, make it hereditary in this caste not to have
any children.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same letter contains some of Gray’s best-known
criticisms, in his faint praise of <cite>Joseph Andrews</cite> and his
warm appreciation of Marivaux and Crébillon. I am not
quite certain that, in this last, Gray intended any uncomplimentary
comparison, or that he meant anything more than
a defence of the novel generally—a defence which itself deserves
whatever crown is appropriated to critical merit, inasmuch
as the novel had succeeded to the place of Cinderella of
Literature. However, both Fielding and Smollett were probably
too boisterous for Gray, who could appreciate Sterne
better, though he disliked “Tristram’s” faults.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the fact is that it is not in criticisms of his contemporaries,
or indeed in definite critical appreciation at all, that
Gray’s strength lies. For any defects in the former he has, of
course, the excuse that his was a day of rather small things
in poetry; but, once more, it is not quite certain that circumstances
would have much altered the case. We must
remember that Mr Arnold also does not come very well out
of this test; and indeed, that second variety of the critical
temperament which we have defined above is not conducive
to enthusiasm.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a> It is, of course, unlucky that Gray’s personal
affection for Mason directed his most elaborate praises to a
tenth-rate object; but it is fair to remember that he does
reprehend in Mason faults—such as excessive personification—which
were not merely those of his friend, the husband of
“dead Maria,” but his own. It is a thousand pities that,
thanks to Mason himself, we have the similar criticisms of
Beattie only in a garbled condition; but they too are sound
and sensible, if <em>very</em> merciful. The mercy, however, which
Gray showed perhaps too plentifully to friends and relations
he did not extend to others. That the “frozen grace” of
Akenside appealed little to him is less remarkable than his
famous pair of judgments on “Joe” Warton and Collins.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The coupling itself, moreover, and even the prophecy that
“neither will last,” are less extraordinary (for the very keenest
eyes, when unassisted by “the firm perspective of the past,”
will err in this way, and Joseph’s <cite>Odes</cite> are, as his friend, Dr.
Johnson, said of the rumps and kidneys, “very pretty little
things”) than the ascription of “a bad ear” to Collins. This
is certainly “a term inexplicable to the Muse.” It was
written in 1746. Five years later an undated but clearly
datable letter to Walpole contains (lxxxiv., ed. cit.) in a notice
of Dodsley’s <cite>Miscellany</cite>, quite a sheaf of criticisms. That of
Tickell—“a poor short-winded imitator of Addison, who had
himself not above three or four notes in poetry, sweet enough
indeed, like those of a German flute, but such as soon tire and
satiate the ear with their frequent return”—is very notable for
this glance backward on the great Mr Addison, though it
would have been unjust to Tickell if (which does not quite
appear) it had been intended to include his fine elegy on
Addison himself, and the still finer one on Cadogan.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Gray
is quite amiable to <cite>The Spleen</cite> and <cite>The Schoolmistress</cite>, and
<cite>London</cite>; justly assigns to Dyer (the Dyer of <cite>Grongar Hill</cite>, not
of <cite>The Fleece</cite>) “more of poetry in his imagination than almost
any of our number,” but unjustly calls him “rough and injudicious,”
and brushes most of the rest away, not too superciliously.
A year later (December 1752, to Wharton) he
grants to Hall’s Satires “fulness of spirit and poetry; as much
of the first as Dr Donne, and far more of the latter.” In
the elaborate “buckwashing” of Mason’s <cite>Caractacus</cite> ode, which
occupies great part of the very long letter of December 19,
1756, there is a passage of great importance on Epic and Lyric
style, which exhibits as well perhaps as anything else the
independence, and at the same time the transitional consistency,
of Gray’s criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>He says first (which is true, and which no rigidly orthodox
Neo-Classic would or could have admitted): “The true lyric
style, with all its flights of fancy ornaments, heightening of
expression, and harmony of sound, is in its nature superior to
every other style.” Then he says that this is just the cause
why it could not be borne in a work of great length; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>that the epic “therefore assumed graver colours,” and only
stuck on a diamond borrowed from her sister here and there;
then that it is “natural and delightful” to pass from the
graver stuff to the diamond, and then that to pass from lyric
to epic is to drop from verse to mere prose. All of which
seems to argue a curious inequality in clearing the mind from
cant. It <em>is</em> true, as has been said, that Lyric is the highest
style. But surely the reason why this height cannot be kept
is the weakness, not of human receptivity but of human productiveness.
Give us an <cite>Iliad</cite> at the pitch of the best chorus
of the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>, and we will gladly see whether we can
bear it or not. Again, if you can pass from the dress to the
diamond, why not pass from the diamond to the dress? It is
true that in Mason’s case the diamonds were paste, and bad
paste; but that does not affect the argument. When, in still
a later letter (clxii.) to the same “Skroddles”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a> he lays it down
that “extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous,
and musical is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry,” we
must accentuate <em>one of the</em>. But there is a bombshell for
Neo-Classicism in cvii., still to “Skroddles.” “I insist that
sense is nothing in poetry, but according to the dress she wears
and the scene she appears in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Gray’s attitude to <em>Ossian</em> is interesting, but very much what
we should have expected. He was bribed by its difference
from the styles of which he was weary; but he seems from
the very first to have had qualms (to which he did some
violence, without quite succeeding, in order to stifle them) as to
its genuineness.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.6'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The</i> Observations <i>on Aristophanes and Plato</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>No intelligent lover of the classics, whose love is not limited
to them, can fail to regret that by very far the larger bulk of
Gray’s  critical <cite>Observations</cite> is directed to Aristophanes
and  Plato. The annotator is not incompetent,
and the annotated are supremely worthy of
his labours; but the work was not specially in need
of doing, and there have been very large numbers of men as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>well or better qualified to do it. Such things as this—<cite>Aves</cite>,
1114: “These were plates of brass with which they shaded the
heads of statues to guard them from the weather and the
birds”—are things which we do not want from a Gray at all.
They are the business of that harmless drudge, the lexicographer,
in general, of a competent fifth-form master editing
the play, in particular. But there was probably at that time
not a single man in Europe equally qualified by natural gifts
and by study to deliver really critical and comparative opinions
on literature, to discuss the history and changes of English,
and the like. Nor has there probably at any date been any
man better qualified for this, having regard to the conditions
of his own time and country. One cannot, then, but feel it
annoying that a life, not long but by no means very short, and
devoted exclusively to literary leisure, should have resulted, as
far as this special vocation of the author is concerned, in some
eighty small pages of Dissertation devoted to English metres
and to the Poems of Lydgate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us, however, rather be thankful for what we have got,
and examine it, such as it is, with care.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.7'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The</i> Metrum.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the very first words of the <cite>Metrum</cite> it is curious and
delightful to see a man at this early period cutting right and
left at the  error of the older editors, who calmly
shoved in, or left out, words and syllables to make
what they thought correct versification for Chaucer, and at the
other error committed by the majority of philologists to-day in
holding that Chaucer’s syntax, accidence, and orthography were as
precise as those of a writer in the school of the French Academy.
Even more refreshing are, on the one hand, his knowledge and
heed of Puttenham, and, on the other, his correction of Puttenham’s
doctrine of the fixed Caesura, his admissions of this in
the case of the Alexandrine, and his quiet demonstration that
the admission of it in the decasyllable and octosyllable would
make havoc of our best poetry. The contrast of this reasonable
method and just conclusion, not merely with the ignorant
or overbearing dogmatism of Bysshe half a century earlier, but
with the perversity, in the face of light and knowledge, of
Guest a century later, is as remarkable as anything in the
history of English criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Gray, of course, was fallible. He entangles himself rather
on the subject of “Riding Rhyme”; and though he, first (I
think) of all English writers, notices the equivalenced dimeter
iambics of Spenser’s <cite>Oak and Bryar</cite>, and compares Milton’s
octosyllables with them, he goes wrong by saying that this is
the <em>only</em> English metre in which such a liberty of choice is
allowed, and more wrong still in bringing Donne’s well-known
ruggedness under this head. And he does not allow himself
to do more than glance at the Classical-metre craze, his remarks
on which would have been very interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>His subsequent analysis of “measures” with the chief books
or poems in which they are used is of very great interest, but
as it is a mere table it hardly lends itself to comment, though
it fills nearly twenty pages. The conclusion, however, is important,
and, without undue guessing, gives us fair warrant for
inferring that Gray would have had much (and not a favourable
much) to say on the contemporary practice he describes
if the table had been expanded into a dissertation. And the
table itself, with its notes, shows that though his knowledge of
Middle English before Chaucer was necessarily limited, yet he
knew and had drawn right conclusions from Robert of Gloucester
and Robert of Brunne, <cite>The Owl and the Nightingale</cite>,
the early English Life of St. Margaret, and the <span lang="la"><cite>Poema Morale</cite></span>.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>His observations on “the pseudo-Rhythmus” (which odd and
misleading term simply means Rhyme) present a learned and
judicious summary of the facts as then known with the shorter
appendices on the same subject.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Lydgate Notes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The observations on John Lydgate which close Gray’s critical
<span lang="fr"><i>dossier</i></span> might have been devoted to a more interesting subject,
but they enable us to see what the average quality of
the <cite>History</cite> would have been. And they certainly
go, in scheme and quality, very far beyond any
previous literary history of any country with which I am
acquainted. The article (as we may call it) is made up of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>judicious mixture of biography, account of books (in both cases,
of course, as far as known to the writer only), citation, exposition
of points of interest in subject, history, manners, &#38;c.,
criticisms of poetical characteristics in the individual, and now
and then critical <span lang="la"><i>excursus</i></span> of a more general kind suggested by
the subject. In one place, indeed, Gray does introduce Homer
in justification of Lydgate: but no one will hesitate to do this
now and then; and it is quite clear that he does not do it from
any delusion as to a cut-and-dried pattern, or set of patterns,
to which every poem, new or old, was bound to conform.</p>

<p class='c001'>And to this we have to add certain facts which, if not
critical utterances, speak as few such utterances have done—the
novelty of Gray’s original English poetry, and his selection
of Welsh and Scandinavian originals for translation and imitation.
These things were themselves unspoken criticism of the
most important kind on the literary habits and tastes of his
country, and of Europe at large. The, to us, almost unintelligible
puzzlement of his contemporaries—the “hard as Greek”
of the excellent Garrick, and the bewilderment of the three
lords at York races, establish<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a> the first point; as for the
second, it establishes itself. To these outlying languages and
literatures nobody had paid any attention whatever previously;<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
they were now not merely admitted to literary attention, but
actually allowed and invited to exercise the most momentous
influence on the costume, the manners, the standards of those
literatures which had previously alone enjoyed the citizenship
of Parnassus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Small, therefore, as is the extent of deliberate critical work
which Gray has left us, we may perceive in it nearly all the
notes of reformed, revived, we might almost say reborn, criticism.
The two dominants of these have been already dwelt
upon—to wit, the constant appeal to history, and the readiness
to take new matter, whether actually new in time, or new
in the sense of having been hitherto neglected, on its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>merits; not indeed with any neglect of the ancients—for Gray
was saturated with “classical” poetry in every possible sense
of the word, with Homer and Virgil, as with Dante and Milton
and Dryden—but purely from the acknowledgment at last of
the plain and obvious truth, “other times, other ways.” As a
deduction from these two we note, as hardly anywhere earlier,
a willingness to take literature as it is, and not to prescribe to
it what it should be—in short, a mixture of catholicity with
tolerance, which simply does not exist anywhere before. Lastly,
we may note a special and very particular attention to prosody.
This is a matter of so much importance that we must<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> ourselves
bestow presently some special attention upon it, and
may advantageously note some other exercitations of the kind
at the time or shortly afterwards.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Shenstone.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the rest of the group mentioned above, Shenstone<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a> is
the earliest, the most isolated, and the least directly affected
by the mediæval influence. Yet he, too, must have
felt it to have engaged, as we know he did, with
Percy in that enterprise of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span> which his early death
cut him off from sharing fully. From his pretty generally
known poems no one need have inferred much tendency of
the kind in him: for his Spenserian imitation, <cite>The Schoolmistress</cite>,
has as much of burlesque as of discipleship in it.
Nor are indications of the kind extremely plentiful in his
prose works. But the remarkable <cite>Essays on Men and Manners</cite>,
which give a much higher notion of Shenstone’s power
than his excursions into the rococo, whether versified or hortulary,
are full of the new germs. Even here, however, he is,
after the prevailing manner of his century, much more ethical
than literary, and shows deference, if not reverence, to not a
few of its literary idols. The mixed character of his remarks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>on Pope<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> (which are, however, on the whole very just) may be
set down by the Devil’s Advocate to the kind of jealousy commonly
entertained by the “younger generations who are knocking
at the door”; and his objection to the plan of Spenser is
neo-classically purblind. But his remarks on Prosody<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> breathe
a new spirit, which, a little later, we shall be able to trace in
development. His preference for rhymes that are “long” in
pronunciation over snip-snaps like “cat” and “not”; his discovery—herald
of the great Coleridgean reaction—that “there
is a vast beauty in emphasising in the eighth and ninth place
a word that is virtually a dactyl”; the way in which he lays
stress on harmony of period and music of style as sources of
literary pleasure; and above all the fact, that when examining
the “dactylic” idea just given, he urges the absurdity of barring
trisyllabic feet in <i>any</i> place, and declares that a person
ignorant of Latin can discern Virgil’s harmony, show us the
new principles at work. Perhaps his acutest critical passage
is the maxim, “Every good poet includes a critic: the reverse
will not hold”; his most Romantic, “The words ‘no more’
have a singular pathos, reminding us at once of past pleasure
and the future exclusion of it.”<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.3.10'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Percy.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Shenstone’s colleague in the intended, his executor in the
actual, scheme of the <em>Reliques</em> was allowed by Fate to go very
much further in the same path. At no time, perhaps,
has Bishop Percy had quite fair play. In his
own day his friend Johnson laughed at him, and his enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Ritson attacked him with his usual savagery. In ours the
publication at last of his famous <cite>Folio Manuscript</cite><a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a> has resulted
in a good deal of not exactly violent, but strong language as
to his timorous and eclectic use of the precious material he
had obtained, and his scarcely pardonable tamperings with such
things as he did extract. Nobody indeed less one-sided and
fanatical than Ritson himself, or less prejudiced than the great
lexicographer, could ignore the vastness of the benefit which
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span> actually conferred upon English literature, or the
enormous influence which it has directly and indirectly exercised;
but there has been a slight tendency to confine Percy’s
merits to the corners of this acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there is much more, by no means always in the way of
mere allowance, to be said for Percy than this. His poetic
taste was not perfect: it could not be so. It was unlucky
that he had a certain not wholly contemptible faculty for producing
as well as for relishing verse, and an itch for exercising
this; while he suffered, as everybody did till at least the close
of his own life, from failing entirely to comprehend the late
and rather decadent principle that you must let ruins alone—that
you must not “improve” your original. But a man must
either be strangely favoured by the gods, or else have a real
genius for the matter, who succeeds, at such a time and in
such circumstances, in getting together and publishing such a
collection as the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span>. Nor are Percy’s dissertations destitute
of critical as well as of instinctive merit. Modern scholarship—which
has the advantage rather of knowing more than Percy
could know than of making a better use of what it does know,
and which is much too apt to forget that the scholars of all
ages are</p>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, whatever may be his errors and whatever his

reagency of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span> is not now matter of dispute; while
it is equally undeniable that the poetical material supplied was
reinforced by a method of historical and critical inquiry which,
again with all faults, could not fail to have effects almost equally
momentous on criticism if not quite so momentous on creation.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.11'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The Wartons.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The two Wartons and Hurd gave still more powerful assistance
in this latter department, while Thomas Warton at least
supplied a great deal of fresh actual material in his
<cite>History</cite>. To none of the three has full justice, as
it seems to me, been recently done; while to one
of them it seems to me that there has been done very great
injustice. The main documents which we have to consider in
the case of the two brothers are for Joseph, his <cite>Essay on Pope</cite>
(1756-71), and the numerous critical papers in <cite>The Adventurer</cite>;
for Thomas, the <cite>Observations on The Faerie Queene</cite> (1754), and
of course <cite>The History of English Poetry</cite> (1774-81).</p>

<a id='sec7.3.12'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Joseph’s</i> Essay on Pope.</div>

<p class='c001'>Warton’s <cite>Essay on Pope</cite><a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a>—vaguely famous as a daring act of
iconoclasm, and really important as a document in the Romantic
Revolt—almost literally anticipates the jest of a
hundred years later on another document, about
“chalking up ‘No Popery!’ and then running
away.” It also shows the uncertainty of stand-point
which is quite pardonable and indeed inevitable in these
early reformers. To us it is exceedingly unlucky that Warton
should at page ii. of his Preface ask, “What traces has
Donne of pure poetry?” Yet when we come immediately
afterwards to the (for the time) bold and very nearly true
statement that Boileau is no more poetical than La Bruyère,
we see that Warton was thinking only of the satirist, not of
the author of <cite>The Anniversaries</cite> and the “Bracelet” poems.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Further, Warton lays down, <span lang="fr"><i>sans phrase</i></span> and with no Addisonian
limitations, that “a poet must have imagination.” He
is sure (<em>we</em> may feel a little more doubtful) that Young, his
dedicatee, would not insist on being called a poet on the
strength of his own Satires. And he works himself up to the
position that in Pope there is nothing <em>transcendently</em> sublime
or pathetic, supporting this by a very curious and for its time
instructive division of English poets into four classes. The
first contains poets of the first rank on the sublime-pathetic-imaginative
standard, and is limited to three—Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Milton. The second company—headed by
Dryden, but including, not a little to our surprise, Fenton—has
less of this poetic intensity, but some, and excels in rhetorical
and didactic vigour. The third is reserved for those—Butler,
Swift, Donne, Dorset, &#38;c.—who, with little poetry, have
abundant wit; and the fourth “gulfs” the mere versifiers,
among whom we grieve to find Sandys and even Fairfax
herded with Pitt and Broome.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is evidently, both in its rightgoings and its short-comings,
considerable matter in this for discussion were such
discussion in place. But the main heads of it, which alone
would be important, must be obvious to every one. In the body
of the <cite>Essay</cite>, Warton, as was hinted above, rather “hedges.” He
maintains his position that Pope was not <em>transcendently</em> a poet;
and indulges in much detailed and sometimes rather niggling
criticism of his work; but readmits him after a fashion to a
sort of place in Parnassus, not quite “utmost, last, provincial,”
but, as far as we can make out, on the fence between Class Two
and Class Three. The book, as has also been said, is a real
document, showing drift, but also drifting. The Time-Spirit
is carrying the man along, but he is carried half-unconsciously.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.13'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The</i> Adventurer <i>Essays</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Warton’s <cite>Adventurer</cite> essays are specially interesting. They
were written early in 1753-54, some years before the critical
period of 1760-65, and two or three before his
<em>Pope</em> essay;  and they were produced at the recommendation,
if not under the direct editorship, of
Johnson. Further, in the peroratorical remarks
which were usual with these artificial periodicals, Warton
explains that they were planned with a definite intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>not merely to reintroduce Criticism among polite society,
but to reinvest her with something more of exactness and
scholarship than had been usual since Addison followed the
French critics in talking politely about critical subjects.
Warton’s own exercitations are distinguished by a touch which
may be best called “gingerly.” He opens (No. 49) with a
“Parallel between Ancient and Modern Learning,” which is
in effect an almost violent attack on French critics, with exceptions
for Fénelon, Le Bossu, and Brumoy. Then, taking
the hint of Longinus’s reference to “the legislator of the Jews,”
he feigns a fresh discovery of criticisms of the Bible by the
author of the Περὶ Ὕψους. He anticipates his examination
of Pope by some remarks (No. 63) on that poet from the
plagiarism-and-parallel-passage standpoint; upholds the <cite>Odyssey</cite>
(Nos. 75, 80, 83) as of equal value with the <cite>Iliad</cite>, and of
perhaps greater for youthful students; insinuates some objections
to Milton (No. 101); studies <cite>The Tempest</cite> (Nos. 93, 97)
and <cite>Lear</cite> (Nos. 113, 116, 122) more or less elaborately.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
Throughout he appears to be conditioned not merely by the
facts glanced at above, by the ethical tendency of these
periodicals generally, and by his own profession of schoolmaster,
but also by a general transition feeling, a know-not-what-to-think-of-it.
Yet his inclination is evidently towards
something new—perhaps he does <em>not</em> quite know what—and
away from something old, which <em>we</em> at least can perceive without
much difficulty to be the Neo-Classic creed. He would probably
by no means abjure that creed if it were presented to him
as a test, but he would take it with no small qualifications.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.14'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Thomas Warton on Spenser.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For a combination of earliness, extension, and character
no book noticed in this chapter exceeds in interest Thomas
Warton’s <cite>Observations on Spenser</cite>.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> To an ordinary
reader, who has heard that Warton was one of the
great ushers of Romanticism in England, and that
Spenser was one of the greatest influences which these ushers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>applied, the opening of the piece, and not a very few passages
later, may seem curiously half-hearted and unsympathetic.
Such a reader, from another though closely connected point
of view, may be disappointed by the fragmentary and <em>annotatory</em>
character of the book, its deficiency in <span lang="fr"><i>vues d’ensemble</i></span>, its
apologies, and compromises, and hesitations. But those who
have taken a little trouble to inform themselves on the matter,
either by their own inquiries or by following the course which
has been indicated in this book, will be much better satisfied.
They will see that he says what he ought to have said in the
concatenation accordingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to decide how much of yet not discarded
orthodoxy, and how much of characteristic eighteenth-century
compromise there is in the opening about “depths of Gothic
ignorance and barbarity,” “ridiculous and incoherent excursions,”
“old <em>Provençal</em> vein,” and the like. Probably there is
a good deal of both;<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a> there is certainly a good deal which
requires both to excuse it. Yet before long Warton fastens
a sudden petard on the main gate of the Neo-Classic stronghold
by saying: “But it is absurd to think of judging either Ariosto
or Spenser by precepts which they did not attend to.” Absurd,
indeed! But what becomes of those antecedent laws of poetry,
those rules of the kind and so forth, which for more than two
hundred years had been accumulating authority? It is no
good for him to go on: “We who live in the days of writing
by rule.... Critical taste is universally diffused ...” and
so on. The petard goes on fizzing and sparkling at the gate,
and will blow it in before long.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the scattered annotations, which follow for a long time,
the attitude of compromise is fairly kept; and even Neo-Classics,
as we have seen, need not necessarily have objected
to Warton’s demonstration<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a> <span lang="fr"><i>pièces en main</i></span>, that Scaliger “had
no notion of simple and genuine beauty”; while the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>his section (iv.) on Spenser’s stanza, &#38;c., is full of <span lang="fr"><i>lèse-poésie</i></span>, and
that (vii.) on Spenser’s inaccuracies is not much better. But
the very next section is an important attack on the plagiarism-and-parallel-passage
mania which almost invariably develops
itself in bad critics; and the defence of his author’s Allegory
(§ x.), nay, the plump avowal of him as a Romantic poet,
more than atones for some backslidings even here. Above all,
the whole book is distinguished by a genuine if not always
understanding <em>love</em> of the subject; secondly, by an obvious
refusal—sometimes vocal, always latent—to accept <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>
rules of criticism; thirdly, and most valuably of all, by recurrence
to contemporary and preceding models as criteria instead
of to the ancients alone. Much of the last part of the book
is occupied with a sort of first draft in little of the author’s
subsequent <cite>History</cite>; he is obviously full of knowledge (if sometimes
flawed) and of study (if sometimes misdirected) of early
English literature. And this is what was wanted. “<span lang="la">Nullum
numen abest si sit <em>conscientia</em></span>” (putting the verse aside) might
almost be the critic’s sole motto if it were not that he certainly
cannot do without <span lang="la"><i>Prudentia</i></span> itself. But Prudentia without
her sister is almost useless: she can at best give inklings, and
murmur, “If you are not conscious of what has actually been
done in literature you can never decide what ought and ought
not to have been done.”</p>

<a id='sec7.3.15'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>His</i> History of English Poetry.</div>

<p class='c001'>This is what gives the immense, the almost unequalled
importance which Warton’s <cite>History of English Poetry</cite><a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a> should
possess in the eyes of persons who can judge just
judgment. It has errors: there is no division of
literature in which it is so unreasonable to expect
accuracy as in history, and no division of history to which
that good-natured Aristotelian dictum applies so strongly as
to literary history. Its method is most certainly defective, and
one of its greatest defects is the disproportion in the treatment
of authors and subjects. When the author expatiates into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Dissertation, he may often be justly accused of first getting
out of his depth as regards the subject, and then recovering
himself by making the treatment shallow.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a> And I do not
know that his individual criticisms betray any very frequent
or very extraordinary acuteness of appreciation. To say of the

</div>

<p class='c009'>that it “displays glimmerings of imagination, and exhibits
some faint ideas of poetical expression,” is surely to be, as
Dryden said of Smith and Johnson in <cite>The Rehearsal</cite>, a “cool
and insignificant gentleman”; and though it is quite accurate
to recognise “much humour and spirit” in <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>, it
is a little inadequate and banal.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this is mere hole-picking at worst, at best the necessary
or desirable ballast or set-off to a generous appreciation of
Warton’s achievement. If his erudition is not unflawed, its
bulk and mass are astonishing in a man of his time; if his
method and proportion are defective, this is almost inevitable
in the work of a pioneer; and we have seen enough since of
critics and historians who make all their geese swans, not to
be too hard on one who sometimes talked of peacocks or
humming-birds as if they were barndoor fowls or sparrows.
The good which the book, with its wealth of quotation as well
as of summary, must have done, is something difficult to realise
but almost impossible to exaggerate. Now at least, for England
and for English, the missing links were supplied, the
hidden origins revealed, the Forbidden Country thrown open
to exploration. It is worth while (though in no unkind spirit)
once more to recall Addison’s <span lang="fr"><i>péché de jeunesse</i></span> in his <cite>Account
of the English Poets</cite>, in order to contrast it with the picture
presented by Warton. Instead of a millennium of illiteracy
and barbarism, with nothing in it worth noticing at all but
Chaucer and Spenser—presented, the one as a vulgar and obsolete
merryandrew, and the other as half old-wives’-fabulist and
half droning preacher—century after century, from at least the
thirteenth onward (Warton does not profess to handle Anglo-Saxon)’
was presented in regular literary development, with
abundant examples of complicated literary kinds, and a crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>bead-roll of poets, with specimens of their works. Men had
before them—for the first time, except in cases of quite extraordinary
leisure, opportunities, taste, and energy—the <em>actual</em>
progress of English prosody and English poetic diction, to set
against the orthodox doctrine that one fine day not so very
early in the seventeenth century Mr Waller achieved a sort
of minor miracle of creation in respect of both. And all these
works and persons were accorded serious literary and critical
treatment, such as had been hitherto reserved for the classics of
old, for the masterpieces of what Callières calls <span lang="fr"><i>les trois nations
polies</i></span> abroad, and for English writers <em>since</em> Mr Waller. That
Warton did not gush about them was no fault; it was exactly
what could have been desired. What was wanted was the
entrance of mediæval and Renaissance poetry into full recognition;
the making of it <span lang="de"><i>Hoffähig</i></span>; the reconstitution of literary
history so as to place the work of the Middle Period on a
level basis, and in a continuous series, with work ancient and
modern. And this Warton, to the immortal glory of himself,
his University, and his Chair,<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a> effected.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.16'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Hurd. His Commentary on Addison.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The remaining member of the group requires handling with
some care. Not much notice has been taken of Bishop Hurd
for a long time past, and some authorities who have
given him notice have been far from kind. Their
unkindness, I think, comes very near injustice; but
Hurd has himself to blame for a good deal of it.
As a man he seems to have been, if fairly respectable, not in
the least attractive; an early but complete incarnation of the
disposition called “donnishness”; a toady in his earlier manhood,
and an exacter of toadying in his later. He lived long
enough to endanger even his critical fair fame; by representing
his admiration for Shakespeare as an aberration, and declaring
that he returned to his first love Addison.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a> And his work
upon Addison himself (by which, I suppose, he is most commonly
known) is of a meticulous and peddling kind for the
most part, by no means likely to conciliate the majority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>recent critics. Most of Hurd’s notes deal with mere grammar;
and while nearly all of them forget that writers like Addison
make grammar and are not made by it, some are choice examples
of the sheer senseless arbitrariness which makes grammar
itself too often a mere Lordship of Misrule and Abbacy of Unreason.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
Yet even here there are good things; especially
some attempts<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a>—very early and till recently with very few
companions in English—to bring out and analyse the rhythmical
quality of prose. But it may be frankly admitted that
if the long-lived Bishop<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> had been a critic only in his
Addisonian commentary, he would hardly have deserved a
reference, and would certainly have deserved no long reference,
here.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.17'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The Horace.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His own <em>Works</em><a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a> are of much higher importance. The
edition (with commentary, notes, and dissertations) of Horace’s
<em>Epistles to the Pisos and to Augustus</em> is in part of the
class of work to which in this stage of our history
we can devote but slight attention, but even that part shows
scholarship, acuteness, and—what is for our purpose almost more
important  than   either—wide   and  comparative   acquaintance
with critical authorities, from Aristotle and Longinus to Fontenelle
and Hume.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.3.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Dissertations.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The “Critical Dissertations” which follow mark a higher
flight, indeed, as their titles may premonish, they rather dare
that critical inane to which we have more than once referred.
Hurd is here a classicist with tell-tale excursions and divagations.
In his <cite>Idea of Universal Poetry</cite>  he will not at first include
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>verse in his definition, nor will he accept the commonplace
but irresistibly cogent argument of universal practice
and expectation. Poetry is the only form of composition
which has pleasure for its end; verse gives
pleasure; therefore poetry must use verse. The fiction or
imitation is the soul of poetry; but style is its body (not
“dress,” mark). Hurd even takes the odd and not maintainable
but rather original view that the new prose fiction is
a clumsy thing, foolishly sacrificing its proper aids of verse.<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
He is most neo-classically peremptory as to the laws of Kinds,
which are <em>not</em> arbitrary things by any means, nor “to be varied
at pleasure.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a> But the long Second Dissertation <cite>On the Provinces
of the Drama</cite>, which avowedly starts from this principle
shows, before long, something more than those easements and
compromises by which, as was said in the last volume,
eighteenth-century critics often temper the straitness of their
orthodoxy. “It is true,” says Hurd,<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a> “the laws of the drama,
as formed by Aristotle out of the Greek poets, can of themselves
be no rule to us in this matter, because these poets had
given no examples of such intermediate species.” It is, indeed,
most true; but it will be a little difficult to reconcile it
with the prohibition of multiplying and varying Kinds. The
Third and Fourth Dissertations, filling a volume to themselves,
deal with <cite>Poetical Imitation</cite> and its <cite>Marks</cite>, the hard-worked
word “imitation” being used in its secondary or less honourable
sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Discourses are, in short, of the “parallel passage” kind,
but written in a liberal spirit,<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a> showing not merely wide reading
but real acuteness, and possessing, in the second instance,
the additional interest of being addressed to “Skroddles”
Mason, who certainly “imitated” in this sense pretty freely.
Even here that <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span> which saves Hurd appears, as where
he says,<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a> “The golden times of the English poetry were undoubtedly
the reigns of our two queens,” while, as we saw in
the last volume,<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Blair was teaching, and for years was to teach,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>his students at Edinburgh, a scheme of literary golden ages in
which that of Elizabeth was simply left out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, these three volumes, though they would put Hurd
much higher than the Addison Commentary, are not those
which give him the position sought to be vindicated for him
here.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Other Works.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Neither will his titles be sought by any one in his <cite>Lectures
on the Prophecies</cite>: while even that edition of Cowley’s <cite>Selected
Works</cite> the principle of which Johnson<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a> at one time
attacked, while at another he admitted it to more
favour, can only be drawn on as a proof that Hurd
was superior to mere “correctness” in harking back to this
poet. Nay, the <cite>Moral and Political Dialogues</cite> (which drew
from the same redoubtable judge<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a> the remark, “I fear he is
a Whig still in his heart”), though very well written and interesting
in their probable effect on Lander, are not in the
main literary. Literary characters—Waller, Cowley, and others—often
figure in them, but only the third, “On the Age of
Queen Elizabeth,” has something of a literary bent, and this
itself would scarcely be noteworthy but for its practically independent
appendix, the <cite>Letters on Chivalry and Romance</cite>.
Here—not exactly in a nutshell, but in less than one hundred
and fifty small pages—lie all Hurd’s “proofs,” his claims, his
titles: and they seem, to me at least, to be very considerable.
It is true that even here we must make some deductions.
<a id='sec7.3.20'></a><span class='sni side12'><i>The</i> Letters on Chivalry and Romance.</span>
The passages about Chivalry and about the Crusades not
merely suffer from necessarily insufficient information, but are
exposed to the diabolical arrows of that great <span lang="la"><i>advocatus
diaboli</i></span> Johnson when he said<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a> that Hurd was
“one of a set of men who account for everything
systematically. For instance, it has been a fashion
to wear scarlet breeches; these men would tell you that according
to causes and effects no other wear could at the time have
been chosen.” This is a most destructive shrapnel to the
whole eighteenth century, and by no means to the eighteenth
century only; but it is fair to remember that Hurd’s Romance
was almost as distasteful to Johnson as his Whiggery. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>now there is no need for any further application of the refiner’s
fire and the fuller’s soap; while on the other hand what remains
of the <cite>Letters</cite> (and it is much) is of altogether astonishing
quality. I know nothing like it outside England, even in
Germany, at its own time; I know nothing like it in England
for more than thirty years after its date; I should be puzzled
to pick out anything superior to the best of it (with the proper
time allowance) since.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.21'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Their doctrine.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>At the very opening of the <cite>Letters</cite>, Hurd meets the current
chatter about “monkish barbarism,” “old wives’ tales,” and the
rest, full tilt. “The greatest geniuses,” he says,
“of our own and foreign countries, such as Ariosto
and Tasso in Italy, and Spenser and Milton in
England, were seduced by these barbarities of their forefathers;
were even charmed by the Gothic Romances. <em>Was
this caprice and absurdity in them? Or may there not be something
in the Gothic Romance peculiarly suited to the views of a
genius, and to the ends of poetry? And may not the philosophic
moderns have gone too far in their perpetual contempt and
ridicule of it?</em>” There is no mistake possible about this; and
if the author afterwards digresses not a little in his “Chivalry”
discussions—if he even falls into the Addisonian track, which he
elsewhere condemns, of comparing classical and romantic methods,
as a kind of apology for the latter, one ought, perhaps, to admit
that it was desirable, perhaps necessary, in his day to do so.
But when he returns to his real subject, the uncompromisingness
and the originality of his views are equally evident, and they
gain not a little by being compared with Warton, whose <cite>Observations
on the Faërie Queene</cite> had already appeared. After arguing,
not without much truth, that both Shakespeare and Milton
are greater when they “use Gothic manners” than when they
employ classical, he comes<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a> to Spenser himself, and undertakes
to “criticise the <cite>Faërie Queene</cite> under the idea not of a classical,
but of a Gothic composition.” He shows that he knows what
he is about by subjoining that, “if you judge Gothic architecture
by Grecian rules, you find nothing but deformity, but
when you examine it by its own the result is quite different.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>A few pages later<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> he lays the axe even more directly to the
root of the tree. “The objection to Spenser’s method arises
from your classic ideas of Unity, which have no place here.”
There is unity in the <cite>Faërie Queene</cite>, but it is the unity not
of action, but of design.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a> Hurd even reprobates the additional
unities which Spenser communicates by the ubiquity of Prince
Arthur, and by his allegory. (He may be thought wrong here,
but this does not matter.) Then he proceeds to compare Spenser
with Tasso, who tries to introduce classic unity, and gives the
Englishman much the higher place; and then again he unmasks
the whole of his batteries on the French critics. He
points out, most cleverly, that they, after using Tasso to depreciate
Ariosto, turned on Tasso himself; and, having dealt
dexterous slaps in the face to Davenant, Rymer, and Shaftesbury,
he has a very happy passage<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a> on Boileau’s <span lang="fr"><i>clinquant du
Tasse</i></span>, and the way in which everybody, even Addison, dutifully
proceeded to think that Tasso was <span lang="fr"><i>clinquant</i></span>, and nothing
else. Next he takes the offensive-defensive for “the golden
dreams of Ariosto, the celestial visions of Tasso” themselves,
champions “the fairy way,” and convicts Voltaire out of the
mouth of Addison, to whom he had appealed. And then,
warming as he goes on, he pours his broadsides into the very
<span lang="fr"><i>galère capitaine</i></span> of the pirate fleet, the maxim “of following
Nature.” “The source of bad criticism, as universally of bad
philosophy, is the abuse of terms.”<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a> A poet, no doubt, must
follow “Nature”; but it is the nature of the poetical world,
not of that of science and experience. Further, there is not
only confusion general, but confusion particular. You must
follow the ordinary nature in satire, in epigram, in didactics,
<em>not</em> in other kinds. <span lang="la"><i>Incredulus odi</i></span> has been absurdly misunderstood.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
The “divine dream”<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a> is among the noblest of
the poet’s prerogatives. “The <cite>Henriade</cite>,” for want of it, “will
in a short time be no more read than <cite>Gondibert</cite>.”<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a> And he
winds up a very intelligent account of Chaucer’s satire on
Romance in <cite>Sir Thopas</cite> by a still more intelligent argument,
that it was only the abuse of Romance that Chaucer satirised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and by an at least plausible criticism of the advent of Good
Sense,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<p class='c014'>“What,” he concludes, “we have gotten is, you will say, a
great deal of good sense; what we have lost is a world of fine
fabling, the illusion of which is so grateful to the charmed
spirit that, in spite of philosophy and fashion, ‘Fairy’ Spenser
still ranks highest among the poets; I mean, with all those
who are either come of that house, or have any kindness for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And now I should like to ask whether it is just or fair to
say that the work of the man who wrote this thirty-three
years before <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> is “vapid and perverted,” that it is
“empirical, dull, and preposterous,” and, at the best, “not very
useful as criticism”?</p>

<a id='sec7.3.22'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>His real importance.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the contrary, I should say that it was not only useful as
criticism, but that it was at the moment, and for the men, the
<span lang="la"><i>unum necessarium</i></span> therein. Why the Time-Spirit
chose Hurd<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a> for his mouthpiece in this instance I
know no more than those who have used this harsh
language of him; this Spirit, like others, has a singular fashion
of blowing where he lists. But, at any rate, he does not blow
hot and cold here. Scraps and orts of Hurd’s doctrine may of
course be found earlier—in Dryden, in Fontenelle, in Addison,
even in Pope; but, though somebody else may know an
original for the whole or the bulk of it, I, at least, do not.
The three propositions—that Goths and Greeks are to be
judged by their own laws and not by each other’s; that there
are several unities, and that “unity of <em>Action</em>” is not the only
one that affects and justifies even the fable; and that “follow
Nature” is meaningless if not limited, and pestilent heresy as
limited by the prevailing criticism of the day—these three
abide. They may be more necessary and sovereign at one time
than at another, but in themselves they are for all time, and
they were for Hurd’s more than for almost any other of which
Time itself leaves record.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.23'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Alleged imperfections of the group.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Literary currishness and literary cubbishness (an ignoble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>but hardy and vivacious pair of brethren) have not failed
almost from the first to growl and gambol over the
mistakes which—in most cases save that of Gray—were
made by these pioneers. Some of these mistakes
they might no doubt have avoided, as he did,
by the exercise of a more scholarly care. But it may be
doubted whether even Gray was not saved to a great extent
from committing himself by the timidity which restrained him
from launching out into extensive hypotheses, and the indolence
or bashfulness which held him back from extensive
publication, or even writing. It was indeed impossible that
any man, without almost superhuman energy and industry, and
without a quite extraordinary share of learning, means, health,
leisure, and long life, should have at that time informed himself
with any thoroughness of the contents and chronological
disposition of mediæval literature. The documents were, to all
but an infinitesimal extent, unpublished; in very few cases
had even the slightest critical editing been bestowed on those
that were in print; and the others lay in places far distant,
and accessible with the utmost difficulty, from each other; for
the most part catalogued very insufficiently, or not at all, and
necessitating a huge expense of time and personal labour even
to ascertain their existence. At the beginning of the twentieth
century any one who in these islands cannot find what he
wants in a published form could in forty-eight hours obtain
from the librarians at the British Museum, the Bodleian, the
Cambridge Library, that of Trinity College, Dublin, and that
of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, information on the
point whether what he wants is at any of them, and by exerting
himself a little beyond the ordinary could visit all the five
in less than a week. When the British Museum was first
opened, in the middle of the last century, and Gray went to
read in it “through the jaws of a whale,” it would have taken
a week or so to communicate with the librarians; they would
probably have had to make tedious researches before they
could, if they chose to do so, reply, and when the replies were
received, the inquirer would have had to spend the best part
of a month or more in exhausting, costly, and not always safe
journeys, before he could have got at the books.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>There was, therefore, much direct excuse for the incompleteness
and inaccuracy of the facts given by Percy, and
Warton, and even Hurd; and not a little indirect excuse for the
wildness and baselessness of their conjectures on such points
as the Origin of Romance and the like. It is scarcely more
than thirty or forty years—it is certainly not more than fifty
or sixty—since it began to be possible for the student to
acquaint himself with the texts, and inexcusable for the teacher
not to do so. It is a very much shorter time than the shortest
of these since theories, equally baseless and wild with those of
these three, have been confidently and even arrogantly put forward
about the origin of the Arthurian legends, and since
mere linguistic crotchets have been allowed to interfere with
the proper historical survey of European literature. The point
of importance, the point of value, was that Percy, and Warton,
and Hurd, not only to the huge impatience of Johnson, the
common friend of the first two, devoted their attention to
ballad, and romance, and saga, and mediæval treatise—not only
recognised and allowed the principle that in dealing with new
literary forms we must use new literary measures—not only
in practice, if not in explicit theory, accepted the pleasure of the
reader, and the idiosyncrasy of the book, and the “leaden
rule” which adapts itself to Art and not Art to itself, as the
grounds of criticism, but laid the foundations of that wider
study of literary history which is not so much indispensable to
literary criticism as it is literary criticism itself.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.24'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Studies in Prosody.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To this remarkable group of general precursors may be
added, for a reason previously given, a couple of pioneers in
a particular branch—one contemporary with and
indeed in most cases anticipating their general
work; the other coming level with its latest instances.
It is for the author of the missing <cite>History of English
Prosody</cite>—which the present writer would have attempted long
ago if his time and studies had been at his own disposal, and
which he may yet adventure if the night and the shadows
permit—to account for if he can, to set forth and analyse as
he may, the curious and unique coincidences of metrical with
general criticism in England. The fact of them is not contestable,
and, as we have seen already, the tyranny of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>absolutely syllabic, middle-paused, end-stopped couplet coincides
exactly with the “prose-and-sense” dynasty in English poetry.
We have seen also that most of the precursors, explicitly or
incidentally, by theory or by practice, attacked or evaded this
tyranny. But not one of them—though Gray’s <cite>Metrum</cite> shows
what he might have done if in this matter, as in others, he
could only have persuaded himself to “speak out”—had the
inclination or the courage to tackle the whole subject of the
nature and laws of harmony in English composition. The two
whom we have mentioned were bolder, and we must give them
as much space as is allowable without unduly invading the
province of that other <cite>History</cite>.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.25'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>John Mason: his</i> Power of Numbers <i>in Prose and Poetry</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In 1749 appeared two pamphlets, on <cite>The Power of Numbers
and the Principles of Harmony in Poetic Compositions</cite>, and on
<cite>The Power and Harmony of Prosaic Numbers</cite>. No
author’s name is on either title-page, but they are
known to be by a Dissenting minister named John<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
Mason. He seems to have given much attention to
the study and teaching of elocution, and he published
another pamphlet on that special subject, which attained
its fourth edition in 1757.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In his poetical tractate Mason plunges into the subject
after a very promising fashion, by posing the question with
which he has to deal as “What is the cause and source of that
pleasure which, in reading either poetry or prose, we derive not
only from the sound and sense of the words, but the order in
which they are disposed?” or, as an alternative, “Why a
sentence conveying just the same thought, and containing the
very same words, should afford the ear a greater pleasure when
expressed one way than another, though the difference may
perhaps arise only from the transposition of a single word?”
One feels, after reading only so far, that De Quincey’s well-known
phrase, “This is what you can recommend to a friend!”
is applicable—that whether the man gives the right answers
or not he has fixed at once on the right questions, and has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>acknowledged the right ground of argument. Not “How
ought sentences to be arranged?” not “How did A. B. C.
arrange them or bid them be arranged?” but “How and why
do they give the greatest <em>pleasure</em> as the result of arrangement?”</p>

<p class='c001'>So also, in his prose tractate, Mason starts from the position
that “numerous” arrangement adds wonderfully to the <em>pleasure</em>
of the reader. To enter into the details of his working out of
the principle in the two respects would be to commit that
“digression to another kind” from which we have warned
ourselves off. But it is not improper to say that, a hundred
and fifty years ago, he had already cleared his mind of all the
cant and confusion which to this day beset too many minds in
regard to the question of Accent <i>v.</i> Quantity, by adopting the
sufficient and final principle<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a> that “that which <em>principally fixes
and determines</em> the quantities in English numbers is the accent
and emphasis”; that though he is not quite so sharply happy
in his definition, he evidently uses “quantity” itself merely as
an equivalent for “unit of metrical value”; that he clears away
all the hideous and ruinous nonsense about “elision,” observing<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
that in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

      <div class='line'>“And many an amorous, many a humorous lay”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>there are fourteen syllables instead of ten, and that “the ear
finds nothing in it redundant, defective, or disagreeable, but
is sensible of a sweetness not ordinarily found in the common
iambic verse.” Further, he had anticipated<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Hurd by giving
elaborate examples of quantified analysis of prose rhythm.
The minutiæ of all this, interesting as they are, are not for us;
the point is that here is a man who has not the fear of Bysshe
before his eyes, or the fear of anybody; who will not be
“connoisseured out of his senses,” and whose brain, when his
ear tells it that a line is beautiful, proceeds calmly to analyse
if possible the cause of the beauty, without troubling itself to
ask whether anybody has said that it ought not to exist.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span></div>
<a id='sec7.3.26'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Mitford—his</i> Harmony of Language.</div>

<p class='c001'>These inquiries into prosody and rhythm formed no unimportant
part of the English criticism of the mid-eighteenth
century.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> The two different ways in which they
were regarded by contemporaries may be easily
guessed, but we have documentary evidence of them
in an interesting passage of the dedication to John
Gilpin<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> of the second edition of the book in which they
culminated, and to which we now come. Mitford’s <em>Inquiry
into the Principles of Harmony in Language</em> represents himself
as having paid a visit to Pye, afterwards Laureate; and, finding
him with books of the kind before him, as having expostulated
with “a votary of fancy and the Muses” for his “patience
with such dull and uninteresting controversy.” Pye, it seems,
replied that “interest in the subject so warmly and extensively
taken by English men of letters” had excited his curiosity,
which had been gratified by Foster’s elucidation of the subject
itself. And Mitford, borrowing the book, soon found his own
excited too.<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The volume of which this was the genesis, appeared first in
1774.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a> The second edition, very carefully revised and extended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was not published till 1804. It may appear at first
sight unfortunate, but on reflection will probably be seen to
have been a distinct advantage, that even this second edition
preceded the appearance of any of the capital works of the new
school except the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>. For had it been otherwise,
and had Mitford taken any notice of the new poetry, we should
in all probability have had either the kind of reactionary protest
which often comes from pioneers who have been overtaken
and passed, or at best an attempt at awkward adjustment of
two very different points of view. As it is, the book, besides
exhibiting much original talent, belongs to a distinct school
and platform—that of the later but still eighteenth-century
Romantic beginners, while at the same time it represents a
much greater knowledge of old literature, helped by Ellis’s
<cite>Specimens</cite>, by Ritson’s work, and other products of the last
years of the century, than had been possible to Shenstone, to
Gray, or even to Warton.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more, its detailed tenets and pronouncements, with all
but the general methods by which they are arrived at, belong
to another story. But these general methods, and some special
exemplifications of them, belong to us. Rightly or wrongly,
Mitford sought his explanations of the articulate music of
poetry from the laws of inarticulate music itself. For this
reason, or for another, he was disposed to join the accentual
and not the quantitative school of prosodists, and to express
strong disapproval of the adoption of classical prosodic terms
in regard to English. He is sometimes arbitrary, as when he
lays down<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a> “that in English every word has one syllable
always made eminent by accent”; and we have to remember
that he was writing after nearly a hundred years of couplet
verse on Bysshian principles before we can excuse—while we
can never endorse—his statement<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a> that “to all who have any
familiarity with English poetry a <em>regularity</em> in the disposition
of accents is its most striking characteristic.” He is rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>unsound on the Pause, but lays down the all-important rule
that “rhyme is a time-beater” without hesitation. He admits
trisyllabic feet even in what he calls “common time”; but (in
consequence of his accentual theories probably) troubles himself
with “aberration” of accent (<i>i.e.</i>, substitution of trochee for
iamb), with redundant or extra-metrical syllables in the middle
of the line, and with other epicyclic and cumbrous superfluities.
But the most important thing in the whole book—the thing
which alone makes it really important to <em>us</em>—is that he supports
his theories by a regular examination of the whole of
English verse as far as he knows it, even back to Anglo-Saxon
times, and that in making the examination, he appeals
not to this supposed rule or to that accepted principle, but to
the <em>actual</em> practice of the <em>actual</em> poets as interpreted to him by
his own ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his errors, therefore (or in what may seem to some his
errors), as well as in his felicities, Mitford exhibits himself to
the full as an adherent of that changed school of poetical
criticism which in the first place strives to master the actual
documents, in the second to ascertain, as far as possible and as
closely as possible, their chronological relation to each other,
and in the third to take them as they are and explain them as
well as it may, without any selection of a particular form of a
particular metre at a particular time as a norm which had been
painfully reached and must on no account be departed from.
He shows the same leaning by his constant reference to the
ear, not the rule, as the authority. The first draft of his book
was published not only when Johnson was still alive, but long
before the <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite> appeared; and it is most interesting
to see the different sides from which they attack the prosodic
character, say of Milton. Johnson—it is quite evident from his
earlier and more appreciative handling of the subject in the
<cite>Rambler</cite>—approaching Milton with the orthodox decasyllabic
rules in hand, found lines which most undoubtedly do not
accord with those rules, and termed them harsh accordingly.
Mitford approaches the lines with nothing but a listening ear,
finds them “not harsh and crabbed, but musical as Apollo’s
lute,” and then proceeds to construct, rightly or wrongly, such
a rule as will allow and register their music.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span></div>
<a id='sec7.3.27'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Importance of prosodic inquiry.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The truth is, that these inquirers both builded and pulled
down better than they knew. Many persons besides Mitford
have begun by thinking controversies about prosody
dull and uninteresting, while only too few have
allowed themselves to be converted as he did; nor
is it common to the present day to find a really intelligent
comprehension of the importance of the subject. On the contrary,
a kind of petulant indignation is apt to be excited by
any criticism of poetry which pursues these “mechanical”
lines, as they are called, and the critic has sometimes even
to endure the last indignity of being styled a “philologist” for
his pains.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet nothing is more certain than that these inquiries into
prosody were among the chief agencies in the revolution which
came over English poetry at the end of the eighteenth century
and the beginning of the next. A sort of superstition of the
decasyllable, hardened into a fanaticism of fixed pause, rigidly
disyllabic feet and the rest, had grown upon our verse-writers.
A large part of the infinite metrical wealth of
English was hidden away and locked up under taboo. Inquiries
into prosody broke this taboo inevitably; and
something much more than mere metrical wealth was sure
to be found, and was found, in the treasure-houses thus
thrown open.</p>

<a id='sec7.3.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sterne and the stop-watch.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One expected figure of a different kind may perhaps have been
hitherto missed in this part of our gallery. Sterne’s well-known
outburst as to criticism, in the twelfth chapter of
the third book of <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>, is far too famous
a thing to be passed over with the mere allusion
given to it in the last volume, or with another in this. Nay,
it may be said at once, from its fame and from its forcible
expression, to have had, and even in a sense still to have, no
small place among the Dissolvents of Judgment by Rule.
“Looking only at the stop-watch” is one of those admirable
and consummate <em>phrases</em> which settle themselves once for all
in the human memory, and not merely possess—as precisians
complain, illegitimately—the force of an argument, but have a
property of self-preservation and recurrence at the proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>moment in which arguments proper are too often sadly lacking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, it must be admitted that there are few better instances
of the combined sprightliness and ingenuity of Sterne’s humour.
“Befetiched with the bobs and trinkets of criticism” is in
reality even happier than the “stop-watch,” and of an extraordinary
propriety. Though he did “fetch it from the coast
of Guinea,” nothing was ever less far-fetched or more home-driven.
The “nothing of the colouring of Titian” is equally
happy in its rebuke of the singular <em>negativeness</em>—the attention
to what is <em>not</em> there, not to what is—of Neo-Classicism; while
the outburst, again world-known, as to the “tormenting cant
of criticism,” and the ingenious and thoroughly English application
of this cant itself to the eulogy of the curse of Ernulphus,
are all too delightful, and have been too effective for good, not
to deserve the heartiest acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time the Devil’s Advocate—who is always a
critic, if a critic is not always an officer of the devil—-may,
nay must, point out that Sterne’s main object in the passage
is not strictly literary. It is assuredly from the sentimental
point of view that he attacks the Neo-Classic “fetichism”; the
“generous heart” is to “give up the reins of its imagination
into the author’s hands,” to “be pleased he knows not why,
and cares not wherefore.” To which Criticism, not merely of
the Neo-Classic persuasion, can only cry, “Softly! Before the
most generous of hearts gives up the reins of imagination
(which, by the way, are not entirely under the heart’s control)
to an author, he must show that he can manage them, he
must <em>take</em> them, in short. And it is by no means superfluous—it
is highly desirable, if not absolutely necessary—to know
and care for the wherefore of your pleasing.” Nor, wide as
was Sterne’s reading, and ingenious as are the uses which he
makes of it, does it appear that he had any very great interest
in literature as such—as being <em>good</em>, and not merely odd,
or naughty, or out-of-the-way, or conducive to outpourings
of heart. He might even, by a very ungenerous person, be
described as by no means disinterested in his protests. For
certainly his own style of writing had very little chance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>being adjudged to keep time according to the classical stop-watch,
of satisfying, with its angles and its dimensions, the
requirements of the classical scale. So he is rather a “Hal o’
the Wynd” in the War of Critical Independence—he fights
for his own hand, though he does yeoman’s service to the
general cause.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. One celebrated person, much associated
with it in some ways, and
referred to in passing above, will not
appear here. Horace Walpole did, for
such a carpet knight, real service in
the general movement; but he was a
literary critic <span lang="fr"><i>pour rire</i></span> only. His
admiration of Mme. de Sévigné is not
really much more to his credit than his
sapient dictum (to Bentley, Feb. 23,
1755) that <cite>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</cite> is “forty times more nonsensical
than the worst translation of an
Italian opera-book.” <span lang="fr">“Notre Dame
des Rochers”</span> talked of subjects that
interested him in a manner which he
could understand: Shakespeare was
neither “Gothic” nor modern. So he
liked the one and despised the other—uncritically
in both cases.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r105'>105</a>. Gray has been upbraided with his

<p class='c001'><a href='#r108'>108</a>. As printed in Mr Gosse’s edition
he is made to say that the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>
was written “almost two hundred years
<em>after</em> Chaucer’s time.” The sense, however,
as well as the use of the word
“Semi-Saxon,” shows that he meant
“before,” so that “after” must be a

which such attention seems to excite
in some minds by no means devoid of
celestial quality. Gradually it will be
seen that current views of prosody are
a sort of “tell-tale” or index of the
state of poetic criticism generally. They
concern us here, however, only at certain

is implied in the very terms of Gray’s
sneer) deal with literary subjects freely
enough;  but their criticism is rarely
important, though I have noted a
good many places. Some of the most
interesting (p. 58 <i>sq.</i>, ed. cit.) concern
Spenser, and Shenstone’s gradual conversion
“from trifling and laughing to
being really in love with him.” From
another (lxii. p. 175) we learn that at
any rate when writing, S. was still in
the dark about “the distance of the
rhymes” in <em>Lycidas</em>. There is seen in
Letter xc., viii. sq., on “Fables,” an
intimation (c. iii. p. 321) of the ballad
plan with Percy; praise of <em>The
Rambler</em>; a defence of light poetry as
being still poetry, &#38;c. &#38;c. It is almost

able to quote not a few writers—Pemberton,
Manwaring, Malcolm, Gay,
who, as well as Geddes, Foster, Galley,
and others, had dealt with this subject.
In fact, the list of such authors in the
eighteenth century is quite long, though
few of them are very important. For
an excellent reasoned bibliography see
Mr T. S. Omond’s <em>English Metrists</em>
(Tunbridge Wells, 1903). Henry Pemberton,
Gresham Professor of Physic,
and a man of various ability, published
on the to us surprising subject of
Glover’s <em>Leonidas</em>, in 1738, <em>Observations
on Poetry</em>, which I had hunted in the
catalogues for a long time, when Mr
Gregory Smith kindly gave me a copy.
It shows, as the election of its text
may indicate, and as its date would
further suggest, no very enthusiastic
or imaginative appreciation of the Muse,
but is remarkably learned, not merely
in the ancients and the modern Frenchmen,
but in Italians like Minturno and
Castelvetro. Pemberton deals with
Epic and Dramatic poetry—their rise,
dignity, fable, sentiment, character,
language, and difference; with Versification,
where his standpoint may be
guessed, from his denouncing “the
mixture of iambic and trochaic” as a
blemish on <span lang="it"><cite>L’Allegro</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>Il Penseroso</cite></span>;
with the Sublime. He is not an inspiring
or inspired writer, but holds
some position, both as influential on
the Germans, who not seldom quote
him, and in the history of Prosody.</p>

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec7.4.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The position of Diderot.</i></div>

<p class='c025'>One of those judgments of the Common Sense which, while
sometimes finding it necessary to contest or correct them, we
have also found in the main not untrustworthy, has
long ago decided that for good or for ill, the weakening
of the neo-classic tradition in its great stronghold,
France, is due originally to Denis Diderot more than to any
one else—nay, that the Germans themselves owe him a heavy
quit-rent. With this decision we shall have no quarrel here;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>on the contrary, a long familiarity with the writings<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a> of this
voluminous and disorderly genius, has made the present writer
one of its very strongest supporters. There is not the slightest
need to engage either in controversy or in compromise with others,
or to hark back upon our own demonstrations that in Fontenelle,
in La Motte, and elsewhere, there are seeds and germs
of a critical calculus very different from Boileau’s. We may
at this stage take these things for granted. Far be it from
us to say that “there’s nothing new or true, and it doesn’t
matter.” But we may very modestly, but very unflinchingly
say that there is nothing wholly new or old; that there are at
least very few things wholly true or false; and that it matters
very much that it should be so.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Difficult to authenticate.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Therefore, or however (for either link of the argument would
be defensible) it is reasonable or convenient to start this chapter
with Diderot. Yet he can hardly have, in mere
space, a treatment proportionate—as proportion has
been in other cases observed—to his importance. It
is an importance rather of attitude and suggestion than of explicit
pronouncement; and the explicit pronouncements are so
many, and so various, that to summarise and discuss them would
require far more than the utmost room that we have given to
our very greatest authorities. Moreover, that inadequate universality,
that flawed all-round-ness, which every competent
critic has noticed in Diderot, would make wildernesses of proviso
and commentary necessary. It is not quite safe to leave unread
a single page of the twenty big octavos of his works, in arriving
at an independent estimate of his critical, as of his general
quality: and those who do not care to undertake so considerable
an investigation, must take the word of those who have
undertaken it, to some extent on trust. Further, though Diderot
is by no means a mere general aesthetician—though his very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>critical value consists largely in the fact that he flies upon the
corporal work of art like a vulture—yet his utterances in
different arts concern and condition one another after a fashion,
of which, before his time, there was hardly any example. We
cannot possibly here bestow space on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Paradoxe sur le
Comédien</cite></span> and the vast and tempting assemblage of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Salons</cite></span>.
Yet the person who attempts to examine Diderot’s purely
literary pronouncements without examining these, will do so
at his peril certainly, and almost certainly to his damage.
<span lang="fr"><cite>Le Neveu de Rameau</cite></span> is imperative: nay, the much-abused
<span lang="fr"><cite>Jacques le Fataliste</cite></span> itself must not be neglected.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.4.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>But hardly to be exaggerated. His Impressionism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Diderot is the first considerable critic—it would hardly be
too much to say the first critic—known to history who submits
himself to any, to every work of art which attracts
his attention, as if he were a “sensitised” plate,
animated, conscious, possessing powers of development
and variation, but absolutely faithful to the
impression produced. To say that he has no theories
may seem to those who know him a little, but only a little, the
very reverse of the truth: for from some points of view he is
certainly a <span lang="fr"><i>machine à théories</i></span> as much as Piron was a <span lang="fr"><i>machine
à saillies</i></span>. But then the theory is never a theory <em>precedent</em>;
it never (or so seldom as to require no correction of these
general statements) governs, still less originates, his impression;
it follows the impression itself and is based thereon.
Not seldom the substructure, if not even the foundation, of the
impression itself may seem to us quite disproportionate to the
originating work of art—be it book, or play, or picture; but
that is not the point. Constantly, the enthusiasm which had
made Diderot give himself up to the fascination of his new
subject may seem to lead him into all sorts of extravagances.
The best known and perhaps the best example of these extravagances,
the almost famous <span lang="fr"><i>éloge</i></span> of Richardson, has been drawn</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>upon by nearly everybody who has written on Diderot, and by
most who have written on Richardson, for examples.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Richardson éloge.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This marvellous dithyramb<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> really exceeds, in the superlatives
of its commendation of a work of originality and genius,
the most “azure feats” of a modern reviewer on a
tenth-rate novelist or minor poet. Richardson puts
in action all the maxims of all the moralists: and
yet all these maxims would not enable one to write a single
page of him. Diderot was constantly going to cry out [He <em>does</em>
constantly cry out “O Richardson!”] “Don’t believe him!
Don’t go there!” to the characters, and especially to Clarissa.
This author sows in the mind whole crops of virtues, which are
sure to come up sooner or later. He knows <em>every</em> kind of life,
and scrutinises its secrets infallibly. He preaches resignation,
sympathy, justice. He has made Diderot so melancholy that
his friends ask him tenderly “What is the matter?” But Diderot
would not be cured for anything. To think that there should
be pedantic, frivolous, insensible wretches who reproach Richardson
with being long-winded! He must be read in the
original. He should be discussed in society. Richardson is
a new gospel: he will always be popular, though thoroughly
appreciated only by the elect. He is truer than history; his
intense interest hides his art; a friend of Diderot, who had
only read the French translation, omitting the burial and will
of Clarissa, wept, sobbed, abused the Harlowe family, walked
up and down without knowing what he was doing, on perusing
the original. Richardson simply haunts Diderot, stifles his
genius, delays him from work and effort. Ye Ages! begone
and hasten the full harvest of the honours due to Richardson!</p>

<p class='c001'>Very extravagant, no doubt; rather absurd, if anybody likes.
But fair and softly; let us, as usual, examine the nature and the
circumstances of this extravagant, this absurd, critical fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, we have to remember that it <em>was</em> a
work of genius—whatever its faults—that was brought under
Diderot’s notice; in the second, that as at least a majority, if
not a consensus, of competent critics has long ago decided, it
was an example or collection of examples of genius applied in
a new way—that without going to the pedantic extremes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>which some have gone in their definition of the novel, it has
been found impossible to discover before Richardson the
necessary mixture of incident and character-interest, the unity
(not necessarily a dramatic or even an epic unity) of plot, the
mingled appeal to, and play upon, passions and manners. Then
let us ask ourselves whether the systems of criticism and the
critics, with which and with whom we are up to this point
familiar, have as a rule proved themselves equal to cope with
new geniuses and new kinds of composition—whether their
tendency has not rather been distinctly to frown upon such
things; at any rate, to give them the coldest and most distrustful
welcome. Let us remember that Hurd, about the
same time as Diderot,<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and in the very act of defending the
older and more poetical romance, was throwing cold water on
prose fiction as a clumsy upstart. And finally, let us ask
ourselves whether all Diderot’s exaggerations are not, after all,
exaggerations of the truth—owing their weak points to an
excitable nature and a prevalent fashion of expression, their
strong ones to a genius, and a perception of truth itself, not
unfairly comparable in their way to Richardson’s own in his.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Reflections on Terence.</div>

<p class='c001'>Side by side in the Works with this effusion there are some
<cite>Reflections on Terence</cite><a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a> written within a year of the other. In
the famous Roman dramatist there is neither novelty,
nor intense sentiment, nor multiplicity of individual
character, nor volume of story. He was the darling
of those critics from whom Diderot differed most.
His faults—at least his shortcomings—are obvious to infinitely
less acute, restless, and rapid judgments than that of
the great Encyclopædist. His excellences are of the kind
which might seem least likely to appeal to Diderot. Yet
Diderot is not merely just to him, not merely bountiful, but
not in the least clumsy or haphazard in his bounty. He will
not have the time-honoured (or <em>dis</em>honoured) putting off of
the praise of Terence on Scipio and Lælius. Admitting his
“lack of verve,” he gives him full credit for its compensation
of even humanity, for his “statuesque” and quiet perfection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>He adds remarks on translation which are excellent; and if he
may have taken the idea of holding up Terence <em>and</em> Molière
together for admiration from La Bruyère,<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a> he escapes La
Bruyère’s mistake of suggesting the <em>mixture</em> of the immiscible.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.6'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Review of the</i> Lettres d’Amabed.</div>

<p class='c001'>Take a third example of a very different kind. We have a
short review<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a> by Diderot (first extracted by M. Assézat from
MS.) of Voltaire’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres d’Amabed</cite></span>. This book, it
is hardly necessary to say, is anti-religious:  and
Diderot was violently anti-religious himself. It is
saturated with Voltaire’s sniggering indecency: and
Diderot was the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Bijoux Indiscrets</cite></span>.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Lastly, it
was by Voltaire, of whom Diderot, though an independent,
was an eager and faithful champion. But it is “without
taste, without <span lang="fr"><i>finesse</i></span>, without invention; a botching up of
stale blackguardisms about Moses and Christ and the rest;
it has no interest, no fire, no verisimilitude, but plenty of dirt
and of clumsy fun.” This is the plain critical truth about the
<cite>Letters of Amabed</cite>, and it is Diderot who says it in so many
words, and says it moreover in MS.—which could curry no
favour with, and obtain none from, public hypocrisy and cant.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><cite>The Examination of Seneca</cite>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Turn the examining instrument from these short pieces to
the long critical examination of Seneca,<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a> which forms the
second part of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur les Règnes de Claude et
de Néron</cite></span>. It is open to any one to agree or disagree
with Diderot’s uncompromising, though by no means
indiscriminate, championship of the usurious philosopher-statesman;
as a matter of fact, though it is a matter
of only argumentative importance, I am, except on the head
of style, one of those who disagree with it. But agree or
disagree as he may with the conclusion, no competent critic,
I should suppose, can fail to admire the thoroughness with
which Diderot has taken in and digested his complicated literary
subject, the range and extent of literary knowledge with which
he illustrates it, the readiness of his argumentation and exposition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and, above all, the craftsmanlike and attractive fashion
in which he combines analysis and criticism. Again, I doubt
whether there is an earlier example of what we may call
“freehand” criticism—the criticism which is not tethered to
the necessity of applying or expounding rules in reference to
its subject, but can take that subject in, can deal with it on
its own plan and specification—can, in fact, <em>appreciate</em>, without
being bound to refer to and obey some official book of prices.
There are some two hundred pages of this appreciation, and
one’s only reason (itself rather uncritical) for qualified satisfaction
with it is that it does not handle some writer of greater
intrinsic value and wider artistic appeal.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.8'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The quality and eminence of his critical position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I should be prepared to multiply the citation and discussion
of the critical “places” in Diderot to almost any extent, if such
multiplication were reconcilable with my plan;  but,
as has been said, to do so would be as superfluous
logically as it is methodically impossible.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> Diderot’s
commanding position, in criticism as well as in
aesthetics, is due not more to the number and
variety of his individual utterances than to the fact that he
certainly obtrudes, and in all probability conceals, no general
æsthetic “preventions” (as the French would say, and as
Dryden very wisely does say) whatsoever. One of the great
resources and one of the great charms of his criticism is the
way in which he draws it from, and returns it to, all the arts
without letting any of them interfere with the other. The
pedants of art-criticism have of course said that his is too
literary; but the pedant is always pedantic, and always
negligible, whether he draws his principles from French classrooms
in the seventeenth century or from French studios in
the nineteenth and twentieth. No matter whether he is talking
of writing or of acting, of painting or of sculpture, the work
of art is for Diderot something which ought to give the human
sense and the human soul pleasure, which, if it does so, is to
be welcomed and extolled, not without (if anybody feels
thereto disposed) inquiry into the manner and the causes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>rather mediate and immediate than ultimate, of that pleasure.
He can everywhere display a really encyclopædic “curiosity,”
in the good sense. He can be extremely inventive and subtle,
as in the famous <span lang="fr"><i>Paradoxe</i></span>;<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a> he can enter into infinite detail
and yet never lose grasp of principle, as in the essay <span lang="fr"><cite>De la
Poésie Dramatique</cite></span>;<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a> he can glance and digress in lightning
fashion as he does everywhere, but especially in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Salons</cite></span>.
As good an instance of this as any is the admirable excursus on
Mannerism in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Salon</cite></span> of 1767,<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a> which is applicable to
literature quite as much as to painting.</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, if any devout Arnoldian says that Diderot’s greatness
is due to his “fertility in ideas,” no contradiction will be
thought of here. But then we have the old difficulty as to
what “ideas” mean. I do not remember that Mr Arnold
himself makes much reference to our Denis; and, indeed,
Diderot must have been, from some points of view, nearly as
horrible—let us lay cards on table and say as incomprehensible—to
him as to his friend M. Scherer. But it may be that
the critical “idea” is neither more nor less than the result of
that contact of subject and critic which has been glanced at
before—a contact intimate, physical, uninterrupted, and resulting
in conception and birth. This, if anything, is the
“idea” of modern criticism; and while few have been more
prolific of such results than Diderot, none before him and
hardly any since have so invariably and consciously guided
themselves by its law. I do not know that he has ever
positively stated this law; I really do not know that it ever
has been explicitly laid down by any of the constituted, or even
the non-constituted, critical authorities. But his whole work
is an exemplification of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the result is, that this whole work, wherever it approaches
criticism, is alive; and that he cannot help its
becoming alive, even if he has apparently given hostages to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Death by attempting set dissertations on cut-and-dried subjects,
or by dallying with science, or atheism, or what not. It is a
further reason why even such contemporaries as Lessing, and
later, Goethe, found in him such an extraordinary stimulus.
The dead, mechanical deductions of too many critics under the
older system could produce nothing but copies, even more dead
and more mechanical than themselves, though, as we have seen
in many a figure of our gallery, the principle of life in human
nature made the greater critics of the older dispensation sometimes
quicken under it. But Diderot’s fecundity was contagious:
his “cultures” have propagated themselves from generation to
generation directly, have set the example of a similar creation
of critical entities to fit subjects ever since. From a formula
you will never get anything but formulas: from the living
contact of critic and subject you will get live criticism.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Rousseau revisited.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I was so severely rebuked by an excellent and friendly critic
for dismissing Rousseau, with but a reference, from  the last
volume, that I thought it my duty to reconsider the
matter, though the principal plea of the rebuker,
that M. Texte had devoted some hundred pages
to Jean-Jacques, appeared to me <span lang="la"><i>nihil ad rem</i></span>. But I might
have committed an error as to the <span lang="la"><i>res</i></span> itself, and so I took
down the four quartos, and went through them to see if my
memory had played me false, as that faculty sometimes does
when one is walking in the browner shades. I need not have
alarmed myself; but it is perhaps worth while to spare a
page to put the <span lang="fr"><i>pièces</i></span> actually before the reader. <i>There is in
Rousseau practically no literary criticism at all from the first line
of the “Confessions” to the last of the “Correspondence.”</i><a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a> No
writer known to me abstains with such an inevitable and tell-tale
deflection from “judging of authors.” His attitude is that
of his favourite Plutarch heightened to a Jean-Jacquian intensity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>It is always of the moral, never of the literary,
character and effect of a book that he is thinking. His fervid
sensibility to the fascination of women, of scenery, of mere food
and wine (for he admits this), does not seem to have extended
to literature at all. By an extremely humorous coincidence (I
do not know whether any one has noticed it before me, but
probably some one has) he writes from Venice—the very place
where he had just received, or was just to receive, the withering
advice, “<span lang="it"><i>Zanetto! studia la matematica!</i></span>”—to order books
from Paris; and they are nearly all mathematics. The famous
<span lang="fr"><cite>Discours</cite></span> about arts and sciences blinks the literary point of
view altogether. The famous Letter to D’Alembert on Plays
would almost adjust itself to plays in dumb show, except that
spoken words have an additional moral or immoral effect.
When Saint-Preux writes to Julie about her studies, he never
so much as glances at the literary value of books: nor is this
touched in all the talk about Education in <span lang="fr"><cite>Emile</cite></span>. The everlasting
moral has dinned the Muses out. So it is in the two
only less famous letters to Voltaire; so everywhere. I replace
my four quartos, having found just one really critical sentence,
in allocation and application only, for Jean-Jacques, probably,
was not thinking of literature at all. But when he asked himself,
“Serais-je damné?” and replied, <span lang="fr">“Selon mes Jansénistes la chose
était indubitable, mais selon ma conscience il me paraissait
que non,”</span> he does <span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span> suggest the revolt of the
Romantic conscience against the Neoclassic.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, but,” they say, “Rousseau’s influence on the mind of
Europe counted for so much in its changes of critical and
creative taste.” <span lang="fr"><i>A la bonne heure!</i></span> and I have recognised this,
and shall recognise it in the proper places. But the agencies
that bring about changes of critical and creative taste, proper
to be mentioned, are not also as proper to be worked out here.
Of such influences the capture of Constantinople is a famous
and undoubted one. Was I bound to tell the story of Byzantine
decadence, and the story of Mussulman progress? It has
in innumerable instances, if not universally, influenced a man’s
criticism, a man’s creation—whether he is in love at the time;
whether he has arrived at that right and happy point, which
Mr Thackeray would not call “a <em>pint</em>” in the drinking of good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>wine; whether he has been under the soothing influence of the
Indian weed. Am I therefore bound to insert in this History a
treatise on “Feminine Attraction,” a book on “The Wines of
the World,” and an “Anti-Counterblast” to King James? In all
seriousness, it may, I think, be requested once more of readers
and of critics that they will “look at the bill of fare.” If the
meat and the wine suit them, well and good; if not, are there
not, in this particular instance, M. Texte and his hundred pages
to make <span lang="la"><i>quaere aliud diversorium</i></span> no merely churlish or vindictive
dismissal? While, as to such remarks as <em>are</em> proper to be made
here on the general critical temper and tendency of the Romantic
movement, they were deliberately postponed in the last volume,
and will find their proper place, not here, but in the Interchapters
of the present.</p>

<p class='c001'>This indirect influence of Rousseau, with the direct influence
of Diderot, no doubt cast a mighty leaven into the mind of
France during the later decades of the eighteenth century; and
it is noteworthy that, of the three remarkable writers with
whom we shall next deal, while Madame de Staël directly and
Chateaubriand indirectly express the first, Joubert was much
in contact with Diderot during his youth. But the dominant
criticism of the last twenty or five-and-twenty years of the
century remained neo-classic; and we have accordingly dealt
with it<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a> in the last volume. Nay, the dominant criticism of
the first twenty or so of the next abode in no very different
state. Here we shall deal with what has not yet been handled
of this half century, or nearly so, in France, isolating more or
less the three great figures above mentioned, and dealing more
in group with these “Empire Critics,” who in different ways
reflect the transition to Romanticism.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Madame de Staël.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the interest, the influence, the significance, and, in so far
as these important things go, the importance, of the work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Madame de Staël<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> in criticism, there can, as to their mere
existence, be no two well-formed opinions. I wish
that I could think this statement—made frankly in
intention, and with deliberate consideration of the
weight of every word—likely to obtain for the examination
which follows the credit of impartiality which I think it deserves.
Unfortunately, we are now approaching closely matters which
are distinctly <span lang="la"><i>cinis dolosus</i></span>. At every step the apparently irreconcilable
difference between those who mean by criticism the
judging and judicial enjoyment of literature, and those who
mean by it theorising about the ultimate causes of such judgment
and such enjoyment, is likely—is sure—to interfere.
Nor does it seem possible for the philosophers to agree to keep
these points of law for the appropriate tribunal, and to let the
rest of the case be stated on its own merits.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.4.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Her critical position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Now “Corinne” is about the first person in whose case
this difficulty and this difference become acute and annoying.
She is not quite so popular with the critics of
“ideas” as she used to be; they have, belike,
discovered at last her rather awkward sciolism of
fact; her very theories are not theirs; the “hideous hum”
of “Madame de Staël : ideas; Chateaubriand : images,” ceases to
tire the weary ear quite to the same extent as it used to do
in histories of literature and critical discussions thereof. But
historically she is not to be denied; there is no doubt that
no one has ever done the popularising of “metacritic”
throughout Europe as she did.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>And work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But if the painful historian were only left to his own
hod-and-trowel work instead of having to draw the
sword and don the helmet against metacritical
raiders, his task would not be a difficult one. Madame de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Staël, unlike her countryman and in some sort master,
Rousseau, <em>is</em> a critic, not merely indirectly, conjecturally, and
by dint of the “must have,” but frankly, plainly, in honest
straightforward deliverances <span lang="la"><i>ad hoc</i></span>. The documents of her
criticism are mainly four: the early <cite>Letters</cite> on Rousseau
himself, the later but still early <cite>Essay on Fiction</cite>, the famous
<span lang="fr"><cite>De La Littérature</cite></span>, and the more famous <span lang="fr"><cite>De l’Allemagne</cite></span>. In
all, but in increasing measure as they come, we see the curious
and interesting development and production of a temperament
originally no doubt possessing some masculine gifts of thought,
as well as many feminine ones of feeling, excited and almost
irritated to the highest activity by the word-fencing of the
<span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span> salons, and presented with all the current doctrines
or fancies in regard to literature and its precincts, by contact
with the most active minds of Geneva, Paris, and Germany.
With her half-masculine vigour and her wholly feminine
receptivity, she absorbs and reproduces, <span lang="fr"><i>tant bien que mal</i></span>, all
or a large part of the ideas which had been fermenting in all
countries more or less, but especially in Germany, for the great
part of a century,—French-Godwinian perfectibility, the æsthetic
of Lessing and Winckelmann, the historical theories of Herder,
as much as she could of the applied criticism of Goethe and
Schiller and the Schlegels. Her different works show her of
course at different stages of this influence. They show also—with
equal necessity and undisguised by a system of explanatory
and supplementary notes in the later editions—what
actual knowledge of literature she had, what stock of
material to expose and submit to all this complicated apparatus,
all this varied range of reagency.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Lettres sur Rousseau.</div>

<p class='c001'>The very early work on Rousseau is of course the most
immature, and it meddles the least with purely literary criticism,
but it is, for reasons obvious <span lang="la"><i>à priori</i></span>, not the
least interesting, and it is perhaps not the least
satisfactory on acquaintance. The contrast between
the modest (but not fairly to be called mock-modest) brevity of
the original Preface, and the pomp and cant and claptrap of the
second, twenty-six years later, may raise a sigh in amiable
breasts. But the text, whether one agree or disagree with
its sentiments and estimates, by no means lacks merit. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>writer is well acquainted with the actual matter of discussion
(which was by no means always the case with her later): she
is in intelligent as well as emotional sympathy with it. She
does not indeed take the purely literary side very strongly;
she had her master’s own practice as warrant for not doing
so. But her remarks (some of which are perhaps innocently
borrowed from Longinus) on Rousseau’s style, and the inapplicability
of the word “perfection” to it are not despicable:
and the characterisations of the various works, though always
tending to the moral and material side, are very far from
negligible. It may be worth noting that while objecting, not
without reason, to <span lang="fr">“les plaisanteries de Claire,”</span><a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a> she does not
seem to know that they are only a corrupt following of
Richardson. But the whole is a very fair <span lang="fr"><i>début</i></span> in criticism,
inclined as we should expect to the moral side, but not
illegitimately so.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Essai sur les Fictions.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur les Fictions</cite></span>, a sort of after-thought introduction
to the three little stories, <span lang="fr"><cite>Mirza</cite></span>, <span lang="fr"><cite>Adelaide et Théodore</cite></span>, and
<span lang="fr"><cite>Pauline</cite></span>, is a slight and rather curious defence of
the novel of actual life moralised, as the most useful
of fictitious or imitative writings, by means of a
survey of such writings under three heads: “Marvellous and
allegorical fictions,” “historical fictions,” and “natural fictions,”
<i>i.e.</i> novels proper, where nothing is true, but everything
<em>true-like</em>. The first two are very insufficiently treated, and
her condemnation of the historical novel is deprived of all
weight by the fact that she wrote too early to know any really
good example of it. Perhaps the same may be said of the
third.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">De La Littérature.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Rousseau</cite></span>, however, is but the work of a novice, and the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Sur Les Fictions</cite></span> is still something of an essay-piece: yet in
both one may observe a <span lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span> towards large generalising,
which was the natural result of the author’s
time, temperament, and education. This <span lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span>
turns into a full spread of wing in <span lang="fr"><cite>De La Littérature</cite></span>, published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>as the centuries met, and when the author was four and thirty.
Its avowed central principle is a transformed “Modernism,”—the
application of the favourite <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span> doctrine of perfectibility
to literature, with an inflexible determination that though
Greek literature may be better than anything before it, Roman
shall be better than Greek, and (though there is <span lang="la"><i>hiatus valde
lacrimabilis</i></span> about mediæval), that modern literature shall be
greater than either. To those who are not pure “ideologists,”
and who do not think that an ounce of generalisation, however
silly, however demonstrably false, is better than a ton of sober
consideration and array of fact, this theory condemns itself at
once. Here, at any rate, we may legitimately echo Mr Burchell
and his “Fudge!”  Yet Corinne’s attempts to prove it are interesting,
and would be more so, if she had had skill enough to
hide her ignorance of the facts themselves, or knowledge enough
of them to gild her paradox. Her actual method is not merely
characteristic of time and person, but has a certain ingenuity:
indeed, it no doubt deceived herself. She will not take literature
<span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, but she takes it in its relations with “virtue,”
“glory,” “liberty,” “happiness,” first in the abstract, and then
under these categories as illustrated by Greek, Roman,
“Northern,” “Southern,” and individual national literatures,
paying special attention to English, and defending it from the
objections of French eighteenth-century critics. It is, of course,
easy to see how, by showing, or trying to show, that virtue, &#38;c.,
is, <em>according to her</em>, better displayed in literature as it goes on,
she proves, or attempts to prove, her general point.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, in the course of the argument, the most
enormous errors of fact, the most startling assertions, which
cannot take the benefit of <span lang="la"><i>de gustibus</i></span>, simply pullulate. The
book nearly drops from one’s hands when one reads <span lang="fr">“Eschyle
ne présente aucun résultat moral”</span>: and the reference to the
<cite>Prometheus</cite> by which this statement is supported, suggests
very forcibly that the writer knew nothing else, and did not
understand this. More allowance must be made, no doubt, for
the point of view, when we read further that <span lang="fr">“les héros (of
Greek tragedy) n’avaient pas cette grandeur soutenue que leur
a donnée Racine”</span>; but what a point of view it is!<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a>  We are in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>full topsyturvydom with the statement<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a> that <span lang="fr">“la philosophie des
Grecs me paraît fort au-dessous de celle de leurs imitateurs les
Romains,”</span> and we do not get out of the  country as long as
the  contrast  of  Greek and  Roman   continues.  But here,  it
may  be  said,  we   are  in  the region of opinion.   The plea
cannot be urged for the astounding statements which diversify
the defence of our own barbarous poetry.  In believing <cite>Ossian</cite>
genuine, as in admiration for it, she, of course, had respectable
companions: but the person who could say<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a> <span lang="fr">“les poètes Anglais
qui <em>ont succédés aux bardes écossais</em> ont ajouté à leurs tableaux,”</span>
&#38;c., could have possessed neither the faintest knowledge of
literary, or even political, history, nor the least extensive
acquaintance with actual examples.  The  note,<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a> <span lang="fr">“le docteur
Blair n’aurait pu juger en Angleterre Shakespere avec l’impartialité
d’un étranger,”</span> betrays the most obvious and complete
ignorance of what <span lang="fr"><i>le docteur Blair</i></span> had actually said.  The
description in the text<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a> of  Falstaff as a <em>charge</em>, a <span lang="fr">“caricature
populaire,”</span> a <span lang="fr">“plaisanterie grossière,”</span>  speaks the lady’s
critical competence with a voice of doom.  But the most
utterly damning page is that<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> which denies inventive imagination
to English poetry; airily dismisses Waller and Cowley as
unsuccessful imitators of the Italians; adds <span lang="fr"><i>je pourrais y joindre
Downe</i></span> (sic), <i>Chaucer</i>, &#38;c.; and a moment later despatches at
a blow, as showing this want of inventive imagination, <cite>The
Rape of the Lock</cite> (full of faults of taste), <cite>The Faërie Queene</cite> (the
most tiresome thing in the world), <cite>Hudibras</cite> (witty, but dwelling
too long on its jokes). Admit (it is a good deal to
admit) that there may be faults of taste in the <cite>Rape</cite>; admit
that more than one Englishman has been unfortunate enough
to find Spenser tedious;  admit that there is even some justice
in the charge against <cite>Hudibras</cite>.  How (except by the easy
method of having never read them) can you leash these three
books together?  and, most of all, by what prank of her own
elves does “that Elfish Queen” find herself between Trulla and
Belinda?   I have myself not the slightest doubt that though
Madame de Staël may have glanced at the <cite>Rape</cite>, and disliked
the sylph machinery, she had never so much as opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Downe” or Chaucer, Butler or Spenser, and I should not
be surprised if she knew nothing, save at second-hand, of
Waller or Cowley.</p>

<p class='c001'>I could multiply examples <i>ad lib.</i>, from the German chapters
especially, but the “matter of Germany” had better be dealt
with under the book exclusively devoted to it. As for general
strictures on the <span lang="fr"><i>Littérature</i></span>, they also will best be postponed
till the <span lang="fr"><cite>De l’Allemagne</cite></span> has been dealt with.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> De l’Allemagne.</div>

<p class='c001'>That this book is, as far as criticism goes, her masterpiece,
there can be no doubt, and it would be surprising if it were
not so. She was older; she had read more; and
she had enjoyed very distinguished “coaching.”
This kept her fairly straight in matters of fact
within the comparatively limited range which she here allowed
herself as far as literature is concerned. German literature
had taken itself by this time pretty seriously for a couple of
generations: and the German men of letters whom she interrogated
or “led about,” were perfectly competent and
apparently not unwilling<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a> to keep her from such absurdities
as we have just been noticing. Very much of the book is
plain, straightforward <span lang="fr"><i>compte rendu</i></span>, and generally <span lang="fr"><i>très bien rendu</i></span>,
whatever minor faults one may find here and there. Above
all, the expressed and very fairly carried out purpose of
comparative study which made Napoleon so angry, and with
such good reason,<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a> gives the book an honourable place as
a precursor, if not, indeed, an absolute origin, in a new way
which had to be trodden. If Napoleon’s innate and colossal
vulgarity had not been constantly tripping up his immense
cleverness, he might have perceived that here was a new
feather of some consequence to stick in his sham crown-imperial.
The analyses and <span lang="fr"><i>précis</i></span> of such short things as
<span lang="fr"><cite>Lenore</cite></span> and the <span lang="de"><cite>Braut von Korinth</cite></span> are rather excessive for
a book: but neither piece is easily translatable into French,
and Madame de Staël probably knew very well that few of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>her dear quasi-countrymen were likely to learn German, in
order to read them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old leaven of French and <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span> taste and culture
shows itself at intervals interestingly. She cites<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a> (a little
generously perhaps in any case) the line in Raynouard’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Les
Templiers</cite></span>, when the reprieve arrives too late to save the
knights who have been chanting hymns on the pyre</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Mais il n'était plus temps; les chants avaient cessés,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>in connection with the yoke of the unities. But, strangely
enough, she does not seem to notice the weakening and
watering down of what she calls <span lang="fr"><i>l’un des mots les plus sublimes
qu’on puisse entendre au théâtre</i></span>, by its being made part of the
speech of a messenger. The voices of the warrior-priests
ceasing one by one in agony, and the reprieve coming on
the silence of the last, would be, though a rather <em>melo</em>-dramatic,
a really dramatic moment. The recital of the situation is a
little less ordinary than talk “of the rain and the fine time,”
and that is all.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is succeeded by some really acute, and in
French quite novel, criticism of Shakespeare as too subtle,
too impartial, &#38;c., for the stage—criticism which she had probably
learnt from Schlegel,—and the whole chapter<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a> is important;
as is that on “Comedy,” though the definition<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a> from
Schlegel himself, with which it starts, is very nearly <span lang="fr"><i>galimatias</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is much good sense in the criticism of German romance,
though the old leaven once more appears in the statement that
“verse is required for the marvellous; prose will not do.”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
Always on Goethe she is good, and, “philosophess” as she is,
she has some very sensible remarks on the over-dose of metaphysic
in Schiller’s criticism. On most of her subjects, indeed,
from Wieland to Jean Paul, she is still worth reading.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Her critical achievement—Imputed.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Her admirers, however,—or the partisans of the  school of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>criticism, which, as has been said, she did so much to “vulgarise”—would
no doubt regard this matter as merely, in
Luther’s famous epithet of contempt, “stramineous.”
It is on her attempt to grasp the principles not merely
of kinds but of literatures, to identify or at least connect these
with national characteristics, and to extend the definition and
comparison beyond even the bounds of nations to national groups—that
they would base her claims. Here, perhaps, we may
find ourselves in a distressing inability to follow. Certainly, no
one will deny that there are some apparent national characteristics
in literature; certainly no one will say that it is
useless or idle to attempt to separate the national and the
generic from the individual. But, in the first place, there was
nothing absolutely new in this, though it might be for almost
the first time used as a frequent implement, and as a fertile
store-cupboard, in literary research. Even the despised Middle
Ages had had national tickets for the different states of the
European republic—had discovered that the Englishman had
a proud look and a high stomach, that he took his pleasure
sadly, and so forth. And had it been newer than it was, it
might still have been distrusted. After all, the literature of
a nation, though we talk of it as if it were something existent
<i>per se</i>, is merely the aggregate of the work of individuals. It
is the work of those individuals that you have to judge; and it
is open to the very gravest doubt whether, in trying the several
cases, the general inductive-deductive ready-to-hand estimate of
the national quality is not more of a snare than of a help. At
any rate, experience proves that those who have been readiest
to use it, from Madame de Staël to M. Taine and M. Texte—to
name no living examples—have been more snared than
helped by it. Your preoccupation with the idea that the
Englishman will be insular and rebel to ideas, the German
unpractical and “inner-conscious,” the Frenchman logical, witty,
tasteful, may very likely, according to the weaknesses of the
poor but constant creature Human Nature, rather lead you to
dispense with inquiry into the fact whether he, the individual
Briton, Teuton, or Gaul, does really exhibit these characteristics.
It will tempt you in the same way to exaggerate what tendencies
he may have to them—to force them on him if he has them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>not—or even to leave him out of consideration if he is so
impudent as too incontestably not to have them.</p>

<p class='c001'>And there is also the gravest possibility of doubt whether,
even in themselves, they have sufficient truth to make them of
more than the slightest value. After all, a man is a man before
he is an Englishman or a Frenchman; it is scarcely too paradoxical
to say that he is himself before he is even a man. The
very greatest men of course carry this disconcerting triumph of
individuality furthest; all but the very smallest help to flaunt
its banner now and then. And when the hasty generaliser
generalises still more hastily, and talks about Literature of the
North and Literature of the South, the Rebellion of Fact is
more inconvenient still. You lay it down that the literature
of the North does not busy itself with frank youthful passion,
and you have to settle matters with <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>; that
the Italian is a light-hearted being whose only wants are sunshine,
an olive or two, a flask of red wine with a wisp of tow
in it, and a <span lang="it"><i>donna leggiadra</i></span>, and there rises before you the
<span lang="it"><cite>Divina Commedia</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.18'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>And actual.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But this argument would tempt ourselves out of the way;
and, even in so far as it is legitimate here at all, is rather for
the Interchapters. Let it suffice that Madame de
Staël is undoubtedly a notable figure in the mere
History of Criticism, and that, like nearly all such figures, she
has by no means lost her actual critical value; that she is no
“shadow”; that she is still, dead as she is, a speaking voice
of some of the perpetual forms and phases of criticism itself.
That her intellectual ability, if only of the receptive and transmissive
kind, was somewhat extraordinary, there can be little
question. She frequently claims for herself the invention of
the word “vulgarity”: and though she lived to be so unfortunate
as to apply it<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a> to Miss Austen—though it has perhaps
been more misused than any other single word of criticism—it
was needed. Nor was she herself much the dupe of words,
though she often was of supposed ideas. She has somewhere
quoted from Rousseau, and expanded, a wise protest against the
requirement of a pedantic adherence to definition in terminology.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>It was unlucky for her, no doubt, that to some extent
she came at, and could not but represent, one of those rather
unsatisfactory transition periods which are neither quite one
thing nor quite another. She has touches of classic “dignity”
and of philosophic cant, harlequinned with others of Romantic
<span lang="de"><i>sehnsucht</i></span> and “naturalistic” passion. Or rather she is like one
of the picture-cleaners’ sign-portraits—half in eighteenth century
shadow, half in nineteenth century light—or the other way
about, if anybody chooses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the ill-luck is not total, and may perhaps even seem to
be but apparent. For it is precisely this <span lang="fr"><i>bariolage</i></span>, this partition,
this intermixture, which gives her not merely her
historical position, but even, I think, her intrinsic attraction
as a critic. She helps us by giving a fresh “triangulation,”
a fresh aspect, a midway stage. Her perfectibilism keys on
as interestingly from the literary side to the old Ancient-and-Modern
dispute as on the political side to the Republican
manias of the time. Her struggles to retain some conviction
of the supremacy of Racine make more interesting, and are
made more interesting by, her admiration for Shakespeare and
the Germans. Her assimilations, or her attempts to assimilate,
the new aesthetic, the new historical theories, the new
wine generally, would have far less interest if she had put away
all fancy for the old bottles. And so she figures worthily and
interestingly in what we have called the French Transition,
with a quaint enough contrast to Diderot, who opens it, and who
taught her German teachers. She is a figure of far less
originality, strangeness, and charm, but she has a more definite
gospel, she is much less diffused and dissipated over the <span lang="la"><i>orbis
scientiarum</i></span>, she points more clearly to a clearly marked out
path, and so she is much more likely to be followed by the
multitude, if not by the elect.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Chateaubriand: his difficulties.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But she does not figure in her place alone: for side by side
with her, and with a face looking still more forward, is another
figure, not less curious, not less blended in its composition,
but to some at least far more interesting
and far greater.  Chateaubriand is one of those
literary personages to whom it is peculiarly difficult to do
justice, and to whom accordingly justice has very seldom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>been done. I admit that it was long before I could myself
regard him through glasses sufficiently achromatic, or divest
him of his accidents with a satisfactory thoroughness. His
personality—that troublesome and disturbing factor from which
we are so fortunately free in the case of most ancient writers,
and with which we are so teasingly confronted in the case of
most modern—is a little enigmatic and more than a little
unsympathetic. He trails with him the trumpery of two
different times—Classical emphasis, arbitrariness, even to some
extent prejudice, Romantic tawdriness, inconsequence, gush.
He has curious adulteries of pedantry and foppishness—strange
and indecent communions of ignorance and knowledge.
And yet he is, in literature, so great a man that one
sometimes hardly knows how to construct any definition of
greatness which shall keep him out of the highest class. He
has, and has by anticipation, all the gifts of Byron except the
gift of writing verse: he can write prose which is hardly
inferior to Byron’s verse in the qualities where verse and prose
touch nearest, and not much below all but Byron’s best in some
where they are farther apart. And he has other gifts to which
Byron can lay no claim.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His Criticism,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The chief of these gifts is criticism—a department in which
Byron, for all his shrewdness, simply does not count, because
of the waywardness, egotism, and personal prejudice
which tinge every one of his critical utterances, eulogistic
or depreciatory. Now Chateaubriand counts in
criticism for a very great deal. By those who allow indirect critical
influence to rank Rousseau as a great critic, Chateaubriand
ought to be ranked as a critic infinitely greater; by those who
observe a more rigid and legitimate calculus, he can, as we shall
shortly show, be ranked almost, if not quite, in the first class.
When a French critic or historian<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a> pronounces him the father
of modern criticism, the first to start the comparative method,
and so forth, he is, as we are all inclined, and as French critics
used to be extravagantly, and are still rather excessively inclined
to do, speaking as if what is true of his own nation and
literature were true universally. We must, of course, go a
long way back in time, and some way afield in place—to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>middle of the eighteenth century in the one case, to England
and Germany in the other—for the real first appearances
(“origins” is always a misleading word) of these things, and
even if we cling to France we must deal with the vaguer but
far older claims of Diderot. But Chateaubriand represents
them powerfully. He represents them practically before
Madame de Staël, in a much more literary fashion, and
with much more literary power, and he represents them with
a magic, with a contagious influence, to which she cannot
pretend. Further, he possesses that claim which is the first,
if not the sole claim for us, though it seems to be regarded
by some with jealousy, and almost with resentment, the
claim of having actually written criticism, and a great deal
of it.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Indirect</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The champions of the Indirect have, it must be confessed,
not a little to rely upon in Chateaubriand. He was so much
more intensely <em>literary</em> than Rousseau, and even than
Madame de Staël, that <i>Atala</i>, <i>René</i>, <i>Les Natchez</i>, <i>Le
Dernier Abencérage</i> still more, <i>Les Martyrs</i> most of all, and
even not a few things in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires d’Outre Tombe</cite></span>, may without
violence be twisted into a literary bearing. All, in their
different degrees and ways, exhibit the author’s insatiable
curiosity as to the literature of different times, countries,
religions, languages, and his indefatigable industry in staining
and twining his own literature with the colours and the
threads of these others. But it is quite unnecessary to twist
and infer, to force the “this must have” and the “we can see,”
when we have two such documents before us as the <span lang="fr"><i>Essai
sur La Littérature Anglaise</i></span>, and, above all, the <span lang="fr"><i>Génie du
Christianisme</i></span>.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and Direct.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, by far the larger part of this latter
famous book, the <span lang="fr"><i>revanche</i></span> for Voltairianism, the manifesto of the
whole earlier, and not a little of the later nineteenth
century, the main pillar of its author’s fame,<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a> is
literary criticism pure and simple. It is so odd a place to
look for this that it sometimes escapes. Accounts of Chateaubriand
have been written (I am, I fear, guilty of one myself) in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which it has had no adequate recognition. But when we have
once sighted our panther,<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a> she cannot escape us; and we may
try here to do justice to the real sweetness of her breath.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.4.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Génie du Christianisme</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>So odd a place: and that, too, in more ways than one. At
first sight—and perhaps <a id='corr112.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to'>too</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_112.5'><ins class='correction' title='to'>too</ins></a></span> hasty or not thoroughly informed
readers permanently—the <span lang="fr"><cite>Génie</cite></span><a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a> may appear an
inextricable tangle, or a frank flinging together of
fragments without even the connection of being
tangled. It would be improved (and perhaps such
a thing has been done) by a table like that which Burton
wisely prefixed to the <cite>Anatomy</cite>. One has to realise the utter
<span lang="fr"><i>terrassement</i></span> in France of Christian doctrine and practice—the
all but total triumph of that purely secular education and
atmosphere for which a hundred years later some of our Nonconformists
pant—to appreciate the real art and the practical
necessity of the fashion in which Chateaubriand “lets everything
go in” against Philosophism. It seems temerity, but
was probably wisdom, to begin, as he begins, with the altitudes
of faith and dogma. And he glides off from them, cunningly
but most naturally, to those ceremonies, sacramental and other,
for which the Republic had substituted unmeaning and unaffecting
civil functions. Then he once more attacks the
<span lang="fr"><i>philosophes</i></span> on their own ground—on the subject of morals and
that “virtue” which they had so tediously dinned into the</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>public ear, but of which they had made so little private exhibition,—and
grapples courageously, though perhaps not rashly,
considering the extreme sciolism of most of his adversaries,
with cosmology and teleology, with physic and metaphysic, with
Hell and Heaven themselves. In all, his rhetoric serves him
admirably, if nothing else does; but we have as yet little or
nothing to do with literature or with criticism. It is quite
different when we come to the “Second Part,” <span lang="fr"><cite>Poétique du
Christianisme</cite></span>, and here Chateaubriand begins to present his
credentials as a critic. Nor, with some digressions, does he
again drop the character throughout the book.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.24'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Its saturation with literary criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The proceeding<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a> was probably more logical than it seems.
On the  one  hand the attack on religion had been overwhelmingly,
and the attack on civil order very largely,
literary in its own character and weapons. In the
second, the everlasting <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span>-republican chatter
about the Greeks and the Romans had more than
reconstituted the old classical and “ancient” prejudice. Madame
de Staël had not shared this latter; but she had failed to
share it principally because of her perfectibilism, which had
put down the merits of the ancients chiefly to their republican
constitutions. Here were a whole host of things for Chateaubriand
to deal with; and in every case the literary way was
an obvious line of attack, as well as one intensely congenial to
the new champion. He is no perfectibilist, of course; in fact,
one of the appendices of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Génie</cite></span> is a <cite>Letter to Fontanes</cite><a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a> on
the second edition of the <span lang="fr"><cite>De la Littérature</cite></span>, combating its
views. But his championship of “modern” literature is based
upon its Christianisation, and he compares famous ancient with
famous modern poets on purpose to show first, how Christianity
has enabled the latter to rise to nobler heights; secondly, how
some at least of the best points of the ancients themselves
are to be found in contact with Christian ethics. Like his
feminine opponent, he has some not quite cleanly rags of
classicism and Gallicism about him. A too sanguine hope
may be dashed when it finds him talking about the “bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>taste” of Dante, and the “defects” of his age. But Romanticism,
no more than its far-off godmother Rome, was to be
built in a day.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Survey and examples.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And we very soon see that for all these remains of “the old
man,” and for all a certain necessary ignorance (he thinks there
is nothing mediæval before Dante but “a few poems
in barbarous Latin),” despite also such antiquated
arbitrarinesses as the admission as a fault in the Milton
whom he so much admires, and in the Dante whom he admires
rather less, that “the marvellous is the <em>subject</em> and not the <em>machine</em>
of the poem”—we very soon see on what side Chateaubriand is
fighting. He hazards at the very opening the doctrine—shocking
to the whole French eighteenth century, and contrary to
Aristotle—that the Epic is not only larger in bulk, but higher,
greater, more varied, more universal indeed, in kind and range,
than the drama. And perhaps this is as much a dividing
principle of criticism as anything else. I hold myself, as has
been made obvious, with those who think that the drama is
only accidentally literary, though it has been so now and
again, for long periods, in the very highest degree; while the
epic is literary or nothing—it is, with lyric, the beginning of
all literature. But, however this may be, the whole drift of
his criticism is anti-neoclassic. Again and again he contrasts
passages and long scenes from Homer and Milton,—not to show
how superior Homer is, as the French neoclassics would have
done, as Addison had done—not even to show how superior
Milton himself is—not to defend Milton by Homer’s example,—but
to show how they are <em>differently</em> excellent. A most interesting
and novel critical suggestion is that of trying to
realise how a modern poet <em>would have</em> done what an ancient
poet <em>has</em> done, the whole lesson of the comparative method
being here in little.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall hardly be expected, though I should much like, to
analyse and represent the whole of these twelve books, to which
something has even to be added from the six last. The
turning of the tables on the <cite>Henriade</cite><a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a> (which is treated most
politely), with a sincere lament that, while the finest places of
its author’s poems are inspired by religion, he has not more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>fully inspired himself therewith in this particular poem (the
subject of which so obviously requires it!) is ingeniously
malicious. We may take mediocre interest in the contrasts
of Lusignan and Andromaque, Guzman and Iphigénie,<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a> but they
are full of delicate and acute critical observation, which shows
itself again in the comparison of Virgil and Racine.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a> So too
we may dispute the epigram that <span lang="fr">“la barbarie et le polythéisme
ont produit les héros d’Hómère; la barbarie et le Christianisme
ont enfanté les chevaliers du Tasse”</span>;<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> but the whole passage
where this occurs is connected with the all-important devotion
to Chivalry. When he comes to passion we may again
desiderate something different from the comparison of Dido
and Phèdre.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> But this was what was wanted “for <em>them</em>”;
and there is no fault to find with the treatment of Pope’s
handling of Héloise.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> With the author’s ecstacies over <span lang="fr"><cite>Paul et
Virginie</cite></span>,<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a> few people now living can sympathise; but once
more <span lang="fr"><cite>Paul et Virginie</cite></span> was good “for <em>them</em>.” Virginie is only
a victim of nasty prudishness when you compare her to
Nausicaa, but she might easily be taken for a mirror of purity
in the age of Madame de Warens and Madame de Puisieux.
The fine passage on <span lang="fr">“Le Vague des Passions”</span> which serves to
introduce <span lang="fr"><cite>René</cite></span> is of great critical importance, though it may
have been partly suggested by Bossuet.</p>

<p class='c001'>The paradox of the beginning of the book on the Marvellous<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a>—that
mythology belittled nature and made description
abortive—is at least exceedingly ingenious, as is what follows
on Allegory; but Chateaubriand’s account of the history of
modern descriptive poetry itself suffers from want of knowledge.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
Still, in attacking the position that pagan mythology
was a more poetic subject than Christian, it must be admitted
that he is excellent on Angels,<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a> and that his comparison of
Venus in the Carthaginian woods and Raphael in Eden, is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of the best of those companion-pieces in which he so delights,
and which are such engaging criticism. We cannot follow
him through dreams and through “machines,” through Hell
and through Tartarus; nor even give much space to the bold,
elaborate, and often admirably critical comparison of Homer
and the Bible.<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a> But these things, like the others mentioned
before, all illustrate the range, the height, the Pisgah quality—or
rather that still higher quality of the mountain view in
<cite>Paradise Regained</cite>—to which Chateaubriand’s criticism can
justly pretend. These thirty pages are perhaps his most
elaborate and ambitious critical attempt, and they deserve
to be thoroughly studied.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hardly less remarkable is the Third Part, which deals with
a sort of clash of influences—that of Christianity on the Fine
Arts, and that of the Fine Arts, Christianity, and Literature on
each other. The wonderfully prophetic instinct of the writer
is shown in what he says of the Gregorian chant, as well as of
Gothic architecture, and he brings them very close to letters;
but of course he comes closer still in dealing with History,
Oratory, and the like. And he manages, in a surprising
fashion, not to keep very far from it, even in his last part, that
of “Worship.”</p>

<a id='sec7.4.26'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Single points of excellence,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These exercitations are diversified and illustrated by constant
expressions and <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> of real critical power, showing, if, as
we have said, necessarily not complete, yet very
considerable, and for the time remarkable knowledge.
Chateaubriand knows all about <cite>Ossian</cite>; and
he corrects Madame de Staël’s amiable and ignorant enthusiasms
with a politeness which must have been insufferable to the good
lady. He has the right phrase exactly<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a> for that singular
failure of a genius the Père Lemoyne—a phrase which may
not improbably have suggested Flaubert’s gorgeous <span lang="fr"><cite>Tentation</cite></span>,
and which is, as it were, a keynote or <span lang="fr"><i>remarque</i></span>-index in
relation to the critical imagination of modern times. He has
not merely this altered tone in <span lang="la"><i>excelsis</i></span>, but also in details:—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>witness the very remarkable note at i. 260, on the effects of
a particular vowel (whether “first discovered” or not does not
matter). On the very same part his open-mindedness is shown
in the warm and just praise given to André Chénier—dead and
unpublished—and a little later in a delicate protest against the
inconsistency of Rivarol’s translation of <span lang="it"><cite>Quel giorno piu non vi
leggemmo avante</cite></span>. The characters of the ancient historians are
sketched with a masterly brevity in III. iii. 3, and there is an
astonishing moderation and justice, as well as a sort of chivalry,
in his frequent encounters with Voltaire.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and general importance.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But the greatest glory of Chateaubriand is that he is, if not
the creator, the first brilliant exponent of what we have called
above the Critical Imagination—the first great
practitioner of imaginative criticism since Longinus
himself. Lessing and Diderot had no doubt shown
the way to this, but the first was not quite enthusiastic
enough, and the second was enthusiastic to and over the verge
of dithyramb. The Schlegels and Goethe had practised in it;
but the two former were not great enough men of letters, and
the most ambitious attempts of Goethe, such as that in <span lang="de"><cite>Wilhelm
Meister</cite></span>, are spoilt by deplorable longwindednesses and pedantries.
Chateaubriand is one of the very first to take the new
stream, <span lang="la"><i>remis atque velis</i></span>, plying the oars of the intellect, and
catching the wind of the spirit. His occasional delinquencies
in the use of the phrase <span lang="fr"><i>mauvais goût</i></span>; his deference to the old
opinion that the hero of tragedy must necessarily be what we
called then in English “a high fellow”; other things of the
same kind; do not matter in the very least. Every one of
them could be set off against a corresponding expression of
freedom from neo-classic prejudice; and there would remain a
mighty balance of such utterances on the credit side.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.4.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Joubert—his reputation.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The critical position of Joubert, acclaimed soon after the
posthumous publication of his work<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a> by the greatest critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>authorities, has sometimes been questioned in later days, but
quite idly. Readers of these pages must have seen,
if indeed they did not know it long before, that
a large body of critical, as of other opinion, is
merely negligible. It does not rest upon any solid knowledge
or argument; it is in many cases not even the expression of
a genuine personal preference, illusion, or impression of any
kind. Sometimes the critic does not like the other critics who
have expressed approval of the author; sometimes he does not
like some individual utterance or group of utterances of the
author’s own; more often he simply wishes “to be different”—to
blame where his predecessors have praised, and to extol to
the skies what they have disapproved or left unnoticed. In
all such cases the verdict need not even be seriously fought
before any court of cassation; it is self-quashed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remarkable body of judgment by French critics<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a> from
Sainte-Beuve downwards, which is prefixed to the usual editions
of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Correspondance</cite></span>, especially if it be supplemented by Mr
Arnold’s famous essay, is almost “document” enough of Joubert’s
worth; but we cannot here avoid full examination of him,
especially as hardly one of these critics has taken our exact
point of view. We can neglect the great body of Joubert’s
miscellaneous <span lang="fr"><cite>Pensées</cite></span> and concentrate ourselves on those affecting
literature, which practically begin<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a> under the heading <span lang="fr"><cite>De
l’Antiquité</cite></span>, appear both here and in the subsequent headings
with general titles, and of course constitute the substance of
“On Poetry,” “On Style,” “On the Qualities of the Writer,”
and “Literary Judgments.”</p>

<a id='sec7.4.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His literary</i> αὐτάρκεια.</div>

<p class='c001'>In literature, with an exception to be noticed presently,
his time exerts remarkably little influence on Joubert.
This is not the case  elsewhere; in his religious,
political, moral, social judgments we feel—and  it
could not be but that we should feel—the pressure,
and the shadow, and the sting, of the Revolution everywhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>But the literature is—as literature is but too seldom and
ought always to be—presented (except in one way) with a sort
of <i>autarkeia</i>. Joubert was born in mid-eighteenth century, and
he died just as the Romantic movement was in full bud and
had begun to burst, with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Odes et Ballades</cite></span>. But he is
neither a hard and fast classic, nor a revolter of the extreme
kind against classicism, nor, like those not uninteresting contemporaries
of his whom we shall group after him, blown
hither and thither by the wind of this or that doctrine. He
betrays, indeed, the enfranchising and widening influence of
Diderot; but he has worked this out quite independently, and
with a “horizontality” and comparative range of view in which
the early Romantics themselves (except Sainte-Beuve) were
conspicuously lacking, and which even Sainte-Beuve never
fully attained. <a id='sec7.4.30'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The Law of Poetry.</i></span> The famous, the immortal, ninth <span lang="fr">“Pensée”</span> of
the Poetry section,<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> <span lang="fr">“Rien de qui ne transporte
pas n’est poésie: La lyre est en quelque manière un
instrument ailé,”</span> is positively startling. It is, of
course, only Longinus, dashed a little with Plato, and transferred
from the abstract Sublime to the sublimest part of
literature Poetry. But generations had read and quoted
Longinus without making the transfer; and when made it is
<span lang="fr"><i>en quelque manière</i></span> (to use the author’s judicious limitation,
which some people dislike so much), final. Like other winged
things, and more than any of them, poetry is itself hard to
catch; it is difficult to avoid crushing and maiming it when
you think to catch it. But this is as nearly perfect a definition
by resultant, by form, as can be got at.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>More on that subject.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of course all the utterances are not at this level. The
fault of the <span lang="fr">“Pensée”</span> itself in general, is that, in human
necessity, it will miss, or only go near ten times (perhaps
a hundred) for once that it hits; and it is easy enough
for a hostile critic in turn to hit the misses. But it is
the hits that count; and, as for them, how astonishing is it
to come across at this date (No. xxv.), <span lang="fr">“Les beaux
vers sont ceux qui s’exhalent comme des sons ou des
parfums,”</span> where you have, put perfectly, all the
truth that exists in the “symbolist” theory of some seventy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>years later! Again (xxxviii.) <span lang="fr">“Dans le style poétique chaque
mot retentit comme le son d’une lyre bien montée, et laisse
toujours après lui un grand nombre d’ondulations”</span>—where the
great quality of the best nineteenth-century poetry, of that
poetry of which hardly anything had been written in France
and Germany, and of which Joubert could hardly know what
had already been written in England—the contingent, additional
music superadded to meaning,—is hit off perfectly once
more. Then there is the second best known and most famous
passage (xli.), forbidding the <span lang="fr">“lieu trop réel,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“population
trop historique,”</span> and enjoining the <span lang="fr">“espèce de lieu fantastique,”</span>
in which the poet can move at pleasure; and that other fatal
saying (xlvi.), <span lang="fr">“On ne peut trouver de poésie nulle part quand
on n’en porte pas en soi,”</span> and the reiteration (xlix.) of the capital
doctrine as to the beauty of words—of words even detached
from context. Taking them together, these ten pages of Joubert
contain more truth—more stimulating, suggestive, germinal
truth—about poetry, than any other single treatise from Aristotle
down to the present day. This is the way a man must think
of poetry if he is to be saved; though not every clause of the
Joubertian creed is thus Athanasian.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Style.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Style section is equally astonishing. I think I first
read Joubert about thirty years ago; I know his ancestors and
his successors much better now; but he astonishes
me just as much as ever. In another rather longer<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
stretch you have the best things in Aristotle, Longinus, and
others—some at least of which he pretty certainly had neither
read nor heard of—revised and applied; you have the principles
and the practice of Hugo, Gautier, Saint-Victor, Flaubert, of
Ruskin, Arnold, Pater, put plumply or by suggestion beforehand
in eighteen pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is everything: the necessity of choice which is the
condition of good style, and which works so differently in
ancient and modern times; the powers of “the word” in all
their varied bearings; the excellence of archaism rightly
understood, and the occasional charms of the <i>kuria</i> as a rest
and interval for refreshment; the right to reinvest an old
word with new meaning; the “science of names”; the placing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of words; the freedom which the reader possesses of improving
on his author by keeping his word and adding to his sense;
the difference between musical and pictorial style; the impossibility
of literature when words are used with an absolutely
fixed value; the unpardonable sin of mere purism; the natural
and justifiable idiosyncrasy of dictionary and even grammar in
good writers, with the due guards against its excess; the
variety of degree in which ancient authors are to be followed;
the value and the danger of idioms. These and a hundred
other things will all be found, sometimes of course (the fault of
the form again) put too absolutely; sometimes, though very
rarely, intermixed with things more dubious—but always
present at short, at all but the shortest notice. Never, I
think, did any critical writer enter so much into the marrow of
things in so limited a space: the section is a sort of <span lang="fr"><cite>Tinctura
Fortior</cite></span>, as the pharmacopœias say, or even like those older
“drop-cordials” of story, where a vial the size of the little
finger contained the virtue of a whole pharmacy.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Miscellaneous Criticisms.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These two sections form the <span lang="la"><i>aureus libellus</i></span> of Joubert—if I
knew a wealthy and sensible, intelligent and obliging bibliophile,
they should be printed on vellum and
adorned by the greatest decorative artists of the age,
and bound in the simplest but the most perfect
coat obtainable. We decline slightly with the two remaining
chapters—though there is still plenty of gold to be found—and
the decline is continuous. In the section “Des Qualités de
L’écrivain et des Compositions Littéraires” we once more
approach the merely philosophic side, and it is Joubert himself
who has left us, apropos of <span lang="fr"><cite>Corinne</cite></span>, the memorable proposition
that sometimes <span lang="fr">“un besoin de philosopher gâte tout.”</span><a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> A fine
distinction (not so expressed) between realist and idealist
literature<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a> is an instance of the consolation which is constantly
occurring; but we must look for relapses. What do we learn
by being told<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a> that “Homer, Euripides, and Menander” (O
groves of Blarney!) had more <span lang="fr"><i>facilité pour le beau</i></span> than Hesiod
and Sophocles; Æschylus, Dante, and La Bruyère less than
Fénelon and J. J. Rousseau? The context indeed shows (not
by any means in so many words) what gloss is to be put on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span lang="fr"><i>facilité</i></span> and what on <span lang="fr"><i>beau</i></span> to get out Joubert’s meaning; but
the result is not worth the trouble. And when we find afterwards
that <span lang="fr"><i>la facilité est opposée au sublime</i></span> we agree, but,
recurring, ask whether Homer is less sublime than Hesiod?
The sub-sections on criticism (§ cxl. <i>sq.</i>) are excellent, and a
fairly severe winnowing would leave a residue not much less
valuable than in the other two: but the winnowing is necessary.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His individual judgments more dubious.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The fact may prepare the wary reader for some further
inequality in the last section of <span lang="fr">“Jugements Littéraires,”</span> with
which should be taken certain letters to Molé in the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Correspondance</cite></span>. To prevent disappointment and
even puzzlement it is here necessary to remember
Joubert’s “time, country, and circumstance.” He
was a man, let it be repeated, of the mid-eighteenth century by
birth; a Frenchman, and not, it would seem, by any means
widely acquainted with foreign languages and literatures,
except classics. He always speaks as if he could only read
Milton in translations; his knowledge of Shakespeare, though
he admired him, is derived from the same untrustworthy
source; of any large part of English literature he necessarily
knows nothing at all. Accordingly—in a fashion which is
nearly unique in this history, but which is priceless in its
unicity—the disadvantages which have been powerless to
affect his general conceptions recover their hold upon him, to
some extent, in particulars. He is still sound on what the
<em>general</em> merits of poetry and of literature should be; but he
sees those merits in the wrong place. At first sight, to an
English reader who is not thoroughly broken to the ways of our
difficult art, it may seem impossible, inconceivable, a bad joke,
that the author of the aphorisms above quoted as to the
necessity of “transport,” the power of words, and all the rest
of it, should admire Delille and not admire Milton. But
remember, he understood the <em>words</em> of Delille—they had,
feeble as they were, the power to excite, according to his own
true and profound theory, that poetry which was ready to
answer and magnify them in his own soul. He did not
understand the <em>words</em> of Milton, and they could not touch him;
while he is certainly not to blame for not being touched by the
words of Louis Racine.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span></div>
<a id='sec7.4.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The reason for this.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This is the most striking instance, the most astounding at
first, the most illuminative afterwards; and it will give us a
key to all the rest. It must for instance be a fresh
stumbling-block, and no small one, to find Joubert,
who could prefer Delille to Milton, quite cool, almost
harsh, to Racine, saying that Racine is “the Virgil of the
ignorant,” that those whom he suffices are “poor souls and poor
wits.” But the way round the obstacle is perfectly clear to
the practised traveller in our country. Racine’s was not the
poetry of Joubert’s own time and generation; Delille’s was.
His language, his words, his imagery could convey whatsoever
of poetry was in them—though it might not be very much—to
Joubert’s ears and wit and soul better than Racine’s could.
And once more, as those ears and wit and soul were exquisitely
sensitive to even a trace of poetry that <em>did</em> reach them, the
difficulty becomes no difficulty at all, but, on the contrary, a
real paradox of the most illuminating and helpful kind, constantly
to be remembered, and especially good against those
estimable doctrinaires who will have a hard and fast hierarchy in
poetry, a “best, better, good, not so good, bad,” arranged in rigid
classes. <em>That is poetry to a man which produces on him such
poetical effects as he is capable of receiving.</em> The reader takes it,
as the writer makes it, <span lang="fr"><i>poeticamente</i></span>. You may possibly—it is
not certain, but it is possible—<span lang="fr"><i>educate</i></span> his poetic sense; say to
it, “Friend, come up higher.” You may certainly remove
merely mechanical obstacles, such as Joubert’s ignorance of
English. But until something of this kind is done, it is better
that the man should even excessively admire Burns or Béranger,
Macaulay or Moore, than that he should simulate admiration of
Shelley, or Hugo, or Heine. It would be pleasant to dwell on
this, which has never, I think, been dwelt upon, or expounded
fully before; but words to the wise must be here, as always,
our motto: the hints given can easily here, as elsewhere, be
expanded by those who have the wits and the inclination.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Additional illustrations.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Some further instances, however, may and must be given of
the  working of this curious state of things, which
makes a critic equal to the very greatest we have
met in abstract appreciation of poetry and literature,
the inferior of many we have met—if not of most who were good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>critics at all—in his appreciation of individuals. There is the
germ of a most important general censure on “Naturalism” (a
thing once more far ahead) in his remark on Boccaccio, that he
“adds nothing to the story,” that he “respects the tale as he
would respect a truth,” a position interesting to compare with
the constant protests of the Goncourts and their fellows against
what has been called “<em>dis</em>realising.”<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a> “Boileau est un grand
poète, mais dans la demi-poésie,” though a little epigrammatic,
is true enough. His few remarks on Molière argue, as we
should expect, a rather lukewarm admiration; but he is among
the highest praisers of La Fontaine, ranking him as (of course
this is before the nineteenth century) fuller of poetry than any
other French author. (Note again that this means, “fuller of
poetry <em>which can bring itself into contact with Joubert’s mind</em>.”)
He admits that his beloved Delille has only “sounds and
colours” in his head, but then they are the sounds and colours
that Joubert can see and hear, and he knows rightly that
sounds and colours make more than half of poetry. As for the
ancients, he remarks with great truth, that Cicero, whom nevertheless
he admired much, has “more taste and discernment
than real criticism.” And then we find the moralist in the
remark, that Catullus unites the “two things which make the
worst mixture in the world, <span lang="fr"><i>mignardise</i></span> and coarseness,” and that
<span lang="fr">“ses airs sont jolis, mais son instrument est baroque,”</span> another
curious instance of the inability of the Latin race to value the
second greatest poet of Latin. Joubert, you see, did not like
the indecency of Catullus, and he did not like his “bitterness,”
as Quintilian calls it; and the dislike barred the poetic contact.
On the other hand, he could see and feel Tacitus. That Pascal
is “exempt from all passion” seems an odd judgment, though
I could, I think, explain it. He is excellent on Bossuet and
Fénelon: less so, I think, on Malebranche.</p>

<p class='c001'>On his own eighteenth century one turns to him with much
interest, but the utterances are too detailed for us to linger on
them. They have the perspicacity (if sometimes a little of the
injustice) of an escaped pupil of the <span lang="fr"><i>philosophes</i></span>. He is very
valuable on Rousseau, but that “a Voltaire is good for nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>at any time,” though he had acknowledged many literary gifts
and graces in this Voltaire, is not merely unjust, but <span lang="fr"><i>saugrenu</i></span>.
Still it certainly raises the point of law, whether “good
for nothing” literature, which is good literature, is not good for
something.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>General remarks.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A few more general remarks may perhaps be made on this
critic, who contrasts so remarkably with all the rest of the
critics of the Empire, and not least remarkably with
his friend Chateaubriand and with Madame de Staël,
beside whom alone of this numerous group he can
be placed. It will be seen that while he is free from “Corinne’s”
hasty generalisations and indigestible “philosophy of literature,”
while he has a less extended knowledge of literatures (though
probably a much more accurate one) than hers, he actually far
transcends her in real philosophy of view, that he takes a
sight of all poetry, all literature, and their qualities, which is
aquiline alike in sweep and searchingness. Further, that
though his knowledge is again more accurate than Chateaubriand’s,
it is more circumscribed, and that he cannot relish
some particular things which Chateaubriand could, yet that
once more he excels his friend in clearness, ideality, comprehension,
and depth. That finally (though the matter of this is
to come), in comparison with all the other Empire critics, from
Fontanes and Geoffroy downwards, a similar <span lang="la"><i>distinguendum</i></span> has
to be observed. One Joubert—the Joubert of the general
views and of the sections on style and poetry—is far over their
heads, out of their sight and reach. The other Joubert—the
Joubert of the particular judgments—is very much nearer
them, though he is sometimes, not always, their superior.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is certain, however, is, that this particular kind of
doubleness (we have seen others more common) is extraordinarily
rare—that though faint touches of it may appear here and
there, they are not more than faint. Joubert’s descriptions
of poetry and his admiration of Delille are no parallel to
Longinus’ definitions of the Sublime and his failure fully to
admire the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. There is no conflict of the higher and the
lower rule, but only an unexampled—yet when we come
to think of it, perfectly natural—inability to get the higher
rule into play. If one could have had not merely the gift of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>tongues, but the gift of conferring it, it would have been
perhaps the most interesting experiment possible in the critical
sphere to have made Joubert a thorough proficient in English, and
<em>then</em> to have seen whether he failed to see the beauties of Milton.
Meanwhile he remains isolated. I do not think Mr Arnold’s
comparison of him to Coleridge a very happy one, though there
are no doubt certain resemblances—the Coleridgean depreciation
of French poetry in relation to the Joubertian of English is the
most striking of these, and might seem sufficient. I do not
think Coleridge depreciated French poetry because he could
not hear it: Mr Arnold himself practically admitted that <em>he</em>
did, and he is therefore himself a better parallel. And Coleridge
had the excuse, which Mr Arnold had not, that French had, in
literature accessible to him, hardly tried the whole compass of
its lyre at all. But this is a digression, only excused by
its helping to point the assertion that there is no one like
Joubert—for Mr Arnold himself knew French very well
indeed.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The other “Empire Critics.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To all these three remarkable writers the term “Empire
Critics,” which has obtained a certain solid position in critical
history from the use made of it by Sainte-Beuve,<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a>
might, as far as chronology goes, be applied. But
they are not the writers who are generally denoted by
the term, these being rather a group extending from
Fontanes through Ginguené, Garat, Geoffroy, Dussault, Feletz,
Lemercier, Marie-Joseph Chenier, Hoffman, and others, down
to Villemain and Cousin, who belong in part even to the Second
Empire, but still represent an older tradition than the men
strictly of 1830. They have been of late somewhat forgotten
and neglected, despite Sainte-Beuve’s weighty pleas for them;<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
and perhaps in hardly a single case (I am not forgetting the
once mighty name of Villemain himself) do they supply us
with a critic of the highest class. But they are extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>important to history; we cannot really understand the criticism
of the last seventy years itself without them. And I do not
regret the time that I have myself spent on them, though I
do not propose, as Agamemnon would say, to equal my treatment
of them to that time itself.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.39'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Fontanes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The novice in these matters who goes from Sainte-Beuve’s
repeated and respectful notices of Fontanes to the latter’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Œuvres</cite></span><a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> may be a little puzzled, even if he take
due heed to the fact that these Works are, as far as
the criticism goes at any rate, only “selected.” There is not
very much in bulk; and what there is may not seem, according
to the severe Arnoldian standard, “chief and principal.”
An introduction and some notes to his translation of the <cite>Essay
on Man</cite>, articles on Chateaubriand, on Madame de Staël, on the
“emphatic” Thomas, &#38;c.:—“we can do all these for ourselves
if we want them, which we mostly do not,” is likely to be the
verdict of the impatient.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it should not be allowed to stand. Fontanes shows us,
in a manner made more historically important by the fact that
for a long time he was a sort of Minister of Literature to
Napoleon, that turning, that transition, which is the subject of
this whole chapter. He still, and naturally, has a great deal
of the eighteenth century in him; but he can see the vacuity
and the frigidity of eighteenth-century “emphasis.” He is
responsible<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a> for teaching Victor Hugo that Voltaire taught <em>us</em>
to admire Shakespeare, one of the most remarkable mare’s-nests
in critical history. But, his eyes perhaps sharpened a
little by personal friendship, he perceived to a very large extent,
if not fully, the importance of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Génie du Christianisme</cite></span>.
So there may have been mixed motives in his different reception
of Madame de Staël’s theories; but there is a singular
and satisfactory compound of eighteenth-century good sense
and nineteenth-century catholicity in his dealing with her
fantasticalities about North and South. He is himself rather
rhetorical at times, but seldom to the loss of sobriety; and he
is altogether a good sample, a good tell-tale, of the attitude of
the inhabitants of a landslip—as we may call it—who see their
old marks changing relation and bearing, who do not wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>like it, but who are capable of adapting themselves, at any rate
to some extent, to the change.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.40'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Geoffroy.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Another interesting and representative person is Geoffroy,<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
who incurred the strictures of Joubert, and has had them “passed
on” by Mr Arnold. Geoffroy—the pillar for many
years of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Année Littéraire</cite></span> and of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Débats</cite></span>, the
“Folliculus” of Luce de Lancival—has received from Gosse
(M. Etienne, not Mr Edmund) the praise of having <span lang="fr">“toujours
marché dans la même route et à la lueur du flambeau qu’il
avait choisi dès le commencement.”</span> In other words <span lang="la"><i>immutatus
et immutabilis</i></span>—an attribution magnificent in some relations
of life; not, perhaps, as we have before noted, in criticism.
Geoffroy’s road and torch might have been better chosen.</p>

<p class='c001'>He, too, feels his time—if he is by no means a Romantic
before or at the birth of Romanticism, he is hardly more of a
Voltairian. But he is first of all “against” everything and
everybody—a child of Momus.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a> He is doubtful about
Corneille and Molière; even Racine is not “perfect” for him.
But his most characteristic passage is perhaps one which
occurs at page 137, vol. ii., of his work cited below. It is a
real <span lang="fr"><i>point de repère</i></span>, because it is one of the last authoritative
expressions of a sentiment—no doubt not yet extinct, but for a
long time kept to some extent in check—the French belief in
the absolute superiority of French literature and the impossibility
of a foreigner being a judge of it—the impertinence
even of his attempting to judge it. Geoffroy rates Blair in the
most approved pedagogic fashion for expressing the opinion—now
probably entertained by the majority of Frenchmen themselves—that
<span lang="fr"><cite>Phèdre</cite></span> is a greater play than <span lang="fr"><cite>Iphigénie</cite></span>, and for
assigning the reason that <span lang="fr"><cite>Iphigénie</cite></span> is too French. He blames
the Edinburgh professor roundly for “meddling with our
authors”; the opinions are not disputable opinions merely—they
are “errors”; Blair and Edinburgh “ought to be ashamed”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of them; they show that the critic “knows nothing about the
matter.” Similar things are, of course, said to-day in England
as well as in France; but <em>they</em> only show the temper of the
particular critic, not the theory of prevailing criticism. Yet
Geoffroy, if only from cross-grainedness, helped in the unsettling
of the merely traditional view of literature: and so did
service.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Dussault.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His contemporary and fellow-worker on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Débats</cite></span>, Dussault,
is of a different type.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a> He is much more amiable in his judgments—has,
indeed, the credit of being a sort of maker of
things pleasant all round; but he is in principle
much more reactionary—he is perhaps the most so of this
group of critics, till they were exacerbated by the Revolters, to
whom he himself refers as <span lang="fr"><i>anarchistes littéraires</i></span>. He is a
staunch Bolæan; and if he has to admit (as with the growth
of literary history it was by his time almost impossible for any
one not to admit) that the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> is not complete, <span lang="fr"><cite>c’est du
moins bien écrit</cite></span>. But he goes far beyond this elsewhere; and
on the 26th of April, 1817—the very year when a certain
<span lang="fr"><i>enfant sublime</i></span> presented himself as a competitor for an
Academic prize—he asks, undoubting of the fact, <span lang="fr">“Pourquoi la
constitution du Parnasse est elle si solide et si durable?”</span> That
the disciples of the Greek and Latin Muses should have anything
to learn by going to “Runes” and such like things is
<span lang="fr"><i>nullement possible</i></span>. Fairy tales are “absurd.” Even the
<span lang="fr"><i>avant-courriers</i></span> of the French classic age meet with no mercy;
and Balzac himself is credited merely with “bad taste.”</p>

<a id='sec7.4.42'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hoffman, Garat, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of another member of the staff of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Débats</cite></span> in its early
days, Hoffman, I know less than of these.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a> He was, like most
of the group, a dramatist, and as might be expected,
and as was the case with all of them, the double
employments reacted not quite beneficially on each
other. Like Geoffroy (with whom, however, he was at variance,
and who told him in effect, with characteristic sweetness, to go
back to his dramatic gallipots and leave criticism alone) he
frowned on the youth of Romanticism, and seems generally to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>have been of the race and lineage of Rymer. Garat, not very
weighty as a politician, possesses little more worth, if any, as a
critic, though he had vogue as an <span lang="fr"><i>éloge</i></span>-writer. Daunou, who
wrote noticeable notices on Ginguené and others, began his
career by a critical essay, two years before the Revolution, on
the influence of Boileau, and was during all his life more or less
concerned with criticism. But he was more of a historian and
student of the political sciences than of a literary critic of
the pure breed. Etienne, Fiévée, Legouvé the elder, the two
Lacretelles, Andrieux,<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a> and others, we must also pass by, though
I have matter for speaking of all of them: but Ginguené, M. J.
Chénier, Népomucène Lemercier, and Feletz are not to be thus
dismissed.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.43'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Ginguené.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The first was an older man than most of the group—in fact,
he was over forty at the date of the Revolution, from the
tender mercies of which he was only saved by
Thermidor. But he ranks in literature, and especially
in critical literature, chiefly by his <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Littéraire d’Italie</cite></span>,<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a>
which did not begin to appear till the second decade of the
nineteenth century had opened, and was one of the earliest
of these comprehensive surveys of literature—other than the
writer’s own or than that of antiquity—which have had
almost more to do than anything else with the formation of
modern criticism. He has been accused of relying too much
on Tiraboschi for his material; but the vice of looking rather at
the commentators than at the texts was an old one, inherited
from classical scholarship, and is by no means extinct a
hundred years after Ginguené's time; and he is rather less
tinged with it than we might expect. His judgments on such—to
a Frenchman of the eighteenth century—dangerous writers
as Dante and La Casa have considerable merit.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.44'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>M. J. Chénier.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Marie-Joseph Chénier, in other respects besides his relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to his ill-fated and illustrious brother, appears to have been
an unpopular and disputable person: nor, putting
his considerable satiric power aside, can he be called
a great man of letters. But, I think, his <span lang="fr"><cite>Tableau
de la Littérature Française depuis 1789</cite></span>,<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a> has been rather undervalued.
It is not, of course, free from the common defects of
these surveys, especially when taken <span lang="fr"><i>à bout portant</i></span>; it notices
much that we do not want noticed at all, belittles important
things, takes refuge in stock phrases and <span lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span> so as to get the
business over. But it is often acute and very much less one-sided
and hide-bound than La Harpe or Geoffroy—recognising,
for instance, in opposition to the latter, that Blair is “always
just” to French writers. And it supplies us, written as it
was just before the dawn of Romanticism (for Chénier died in
1811), with some interesting and necessarily unbiassed views.
People, he says,<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> do not read Le Bossu at all, and they read
Bouhours very little. He greatly prefers Diderot and Marmontel
(though he thinks them “paradoxical”) to Batteux; and if he
is complimentary to Voltaire and even to Thomas, rejoices in
Fénelon and Corneille. He cannot, or will not, understand
Chateaubriand;<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a> but he takes frequent opportunity, under the
guise of noticing translations, to refer to and estimate English
and German literature. In short, he is open to the reproach
of “not knowing where he is,” but the very evidences of this
are useful to us.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.45'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Lemercier.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Still more relatively, and very much more intrinsically
interesting, is Népomucène Lemercier—that singular first
sketch of a Victor Hugo, who, naturally enough,
would have none of Victor Hugo himself when he
appeared, and who, in a cruel trick of Fate and Death, was
actually supplanted by Hugo in his Academic Chair. It is
unfortunate that Lemercier’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Cours de Littérature Générale</cite></span><a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>not a very common book. It has something of the excessive
generalisation of the eighteenth-century—men were struck by
the effect of measured sounds and wrote poetry, &#38;c.; and he
still sticks to Kinds a good deal. But his independence is unmistakable.
He slights the unities superbly; has what is, I
think, the finest passage on Shakespeare written by a Frenchman
up to his day, on “The English Aeschylus;” condemns
<span lang="fr"><i>la pernicieuse manie de critiquer opiniâtrement</i></span>; qualifies and
redeems his tendency to begin “in the air” with “<i>the</i> chimerical,”
“<i>the</i> marvellous,” “<i>the</i> allegoric,” &#38;c., by invariably
condescending upon particulars in the true critical way; and,
as became the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Panhypocrisiade</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Pinto</cite></span>, defends
Aristophanes against La Harpe. Unfortunately he followed
(intentionally or not) Aristotle in confining himself to Drama
and Epic. But he is a really stimulating and germinal writer,
and represents the morrow among his own contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our last critic, before we come to those who in a way
stand for both Empires, is a curious contrast both to the
critic of the type of Geoffroy and to the critic of the type of
Lemercier. Charles Marie Dorimont, Abbé de Feletz,<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a>
who died in the very middle of the nineteenth century
at the age of eighty-three, was with Geoffroy himself, Dussault,
and Hoffman, one of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Débats</cite></span> Four, and like them was
something of an anti-Romantic. But he was a man of amiable
temper, of many friends and of much addiction to society, so
that he rather flicked than lashed. His information as to the
foreign subjects which he often affected was not exhaustive,
and the praise, as well as the blame, of his not quite novel
remark that in the <span lang="fr"><i>pièces difformes et barbares</i></span> of Shakespeare
there are <span lang="fr"><i>beautés veritables</i></span>, are both weakened by the fact that
he thinks Falstaff is hanged on the Stage in the <cite>Merry Wives</cite>.
But he reviews novels obviously by preference, can like <cite>Joseph
Andrews</cite>, and can enjoy Miss Edgeworth. In which things a
door, great and effectual, is opened, though Feletz doubtless
knew it not.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the remarkable pair<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a>—united in their lives, their careers
and their reputation—who, being first known under the first
Empire, died in the same year a little before the close
of the second, Cousin concerns us less than may be
generally thought. He touched not a few literary subjects,<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a> but
always preferably, and for the most part exclusively, from the
philosophical, social, or some other non-literary side. <a id='sec7.4.48'></a><span class='sni side7'><span lang="fr"><i>Villemain</i></span>:</span> With
Villemain it is different. He, too, was a politician, a historian,
and what not, but he was a man of letters, and a man of
critical letters, first of all. His second Academic prize, as a very
young man, was gained by a paper on “The Advantages and
Disadvantages of Criticism;” of the fifteen volumes
of his collected works<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a> the greater part consists of
literary history or estimate; he was Professor of <span lang="fr">“Eloquence
Française,”</span> that is to say French Literature; he was for a long
period of years almost autocratic in the distribution of prizes
and promotions at the Academy, of which he was <span lang="fr">“Secrétaire
Perpetuel;”</span> and it has long been, and to some extent still is,
the correct and orthodox thing to speak of him as having initiated
the modern critical movement in France, and shared with the
Schlegels the credit of initiating that of Europe generally.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.49'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>his claims</i>:</div>

<p class='c001'>From all this men must come to the fifteen volumes with
high expectations—a little chequered perhaps in the case of the
wary by some cautions of Sainte-Beuve’s.<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a> To describe
the result as unmixed disappointment would
be unfair. The mere dates and contents of the books taken
together establish the fact that the debt owed by literary and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>critical history to Villemain is great, and one of those which
will never be written off the <span lang="fr"><i>grand livre</i></span> of the subject. That
between 1816, the year of his appointment as Professor, and
1828, that of the first publication of his <span lang="fr"><cite>Cours de la Littérature
Française</cite></span>, French students first, and then French readers, had
presented to them for the first time a survey of their literature,
which included a historical view of its own origins and earlier
achievements, and something like a comparative view of the
achievements of other nations, is a thing the greatness of which
is not likely to be denied or minimised here. Villemain’s style
is always correct and agreeable, and he did much to establish,
for French criticism in the nineteenth-century, that repute for
“honeying the cup,” which has become something of a superstition.
Sainte-Beuve, in the passage just referred to, may give
him a little too much credit for acuteness and wit in his
individual observations, but he has both.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.50'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Deductions to be made from them.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Unluckily, however, the entries on the other side of the
sheet are numerous and grave. There is not merely the fault,
which his great successor justly brings against him—a fault
from which, by the way, Sainte-Beuve himself was by no
means free—that Villemain is afraid of <em>concluding</em>, that he
seldom or never gives you a clear, “grasped,” summed-up view
of his whole subject or man. Very few critics do. But in
details also his work is too often unsatisfactory. His numerous
“Reports” on academic competitions, which give opportunity
for excellent criticism, are elegant, but hollow and rhetorical, as
is his rather famous <span lang="fr"><cite>Tableau de l’Eloquence Chrétienne au IVème
Siècle</cite></span>. His notices of various ancient and modern writers are
much boiled down from others, with the result,
not usual in physical boiling-down, of being not
thick but thin—those of Lucretius, and of the tempting
and almost virgin subject of the Greek Romances, especially
so. Comparative and liberal as he is, his judgment of Shakespeare
will not stand beside Lemercier’s (he says definitely that
Shakespeare does <em>not</em> provide, in the same proportion as the
Greeks, “universal beauties”), and his estimate of Milton is
beggarly beside Chateaubriand’s. With all his reputation for
rehabilitating mediæval literature, he seems to have known it
little: he is not merely very superficial on Chaucer, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>might be pardonable in a Frenchman, but actually sweeps the
mighty volume of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chansons de geste</cite></span> away at one stroke by
the words “we had no poetry at once rude and vigorous.” He
is sound upon <cite>Ossian</cite>—that craze was dying and could survive
even rudimentary comparative study of literature in no one of
talent; and his thirty-ninth and fortieth lectures in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Cours</cite></span>
on Criticism itself deserve to be very well spoken of. But on the
whole he is disappointing. We must, of course, make allowance—very
large allowance—for a pioneer who begins early,
who finds others, during the course of his long life, extending
his own explorations far beyond his own limits, and who, from
other engagements, from routine, or from sheer disenchantment
or worse, declines to follow them; we must increase it for his
industry in other matters; we must give him his just part and
royalty in the accomplishment of those who followed, and not a
few of whom he actually taught, while all owed him something
indirectly. But intrinsically and absolutely I do not find him a
very great or even a very good critic. He is deficient in
enthusiasm, in originality, in grasp: nor does he quite make
up the deficiency by erudition and method.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.51'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Beyle.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Two remarkable persons, one standing apart a little—as
he, like his disciple Mérimée, always and in all things did—the
other a polyhistoric talent just short of genius,
have yet to be mentioned: and these are Henri
Beyle and Charles Nodier. Beyle was, in a sense, nothing
if not critical; and the spirit of criticism pervades all his
work, both the earlier and better known novels and nondescripts,
and the posthumous volumes (deserving very
much the same alliteration), which have more recently been
made known by the devoted labours of M. Stryienski. But
the “place” for his literary criticism is, of course, <span lang="fr"><cite>Racine et
Shakespeare</cite></span>, published in 1822, ere yet the Romantic party
(to which Beyle himself never belonged) was fully formed,
but when the principles “atmosphered” by Diderot, and held
in various ways and degrees from Chateaubriand and Madame
de Stael onward, had already begun to influence Frenchmen at
large.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.52'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Racine et Shakespeare.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The book itself<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a> is a very curious one. Originally making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>its bow as a couple of review articles, it received all sorts of
accretions, internal and appended, and, in its latest
form especially, is something of a <span lang="fr"><i>potpourri</i></span>. The
title so far applies to the whole that the author is
generally supporting the <em>methods</em> of Shakespeare against the
<em>methods</em> of Racine: but a very small portion of the book is
directly occupied with either. And an unwary reader, expecting
to find a straightforward and consistent Romantic propaganda,
may be almost hopelessly puzzled, not merely by Beyle’s zigzag
digressions striking in all directions like forked lightning, but
by such things as his constant and sustained polemic against
Molière, who has generally been the one writer of the <span lang="fr"><i>grand
siècle</i></span> (or with Corneille one of the two writers) taken under
Romantic protection. In fact no book can better illustrate the
confusion and yeastiness of thought in that early Romantic
period, and the unconquerable, even when perverse, idiosyncrasy
and individuality of Beyle himself. Much of the piece
is an attack upon verse-tragedy <em>as</em> verse, for here, as elsewhere,
this partisan of the greatest of all poets distinctly frowns on
poetry as such. He bases himself on Scott almost as much as
on Shakespeare, yet he is terribly disturbed by Sir Walter’s
politics, and recurs again and again, more in sorrow than in
anger, but with singular lack of humour,<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a> to the story of the
glass that George IV. drank out of, and that Scott first
pocketed and then sat upon. Politics, indeed, run very high
throughout, and one is never quite sure that Beyle’s dislike of
Racine and Molière is not mainly (he would himself admit it as
partly) based on dislike of an absolute monarchy and a courtly
state of society. Here he divagates into a long controversy with
the unfortunate <span lang="fr"><i>perruque</i></span> Auger: elsewhere into an almost
totally irrelevant excursus on Lord Byron, Italy, and the
wickedness of the English aristocracy. Yet he cannot help
being critically valuable almost everywhere, and he generally
“says true things,” though he constantly “calls them by wrong
names.” How forcible and original is the definition of Scott’s<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a>
form of novel as “a romantic tragedy [or, we may add, ‘a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>romantic comedy’], with long inserted descriptions.” His
battle<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a> early in the piece with a “Classic” on the dramatic
<span lang="fr"><i>illusion parfaite</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>illusion imparfaite</i></span>, is conducted in a
masterly and victorious manner, though some of us would like
to challenge the victor to another duel, on the point whether
<em>theatrical</em> illusion is not always, and of necessity, even less than
“imperfect,” and whether to obtain perfect “illusion” you must
not <em>read</em> and read only.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a> Excellently acute too, for his time,
though to ours it may seem a truism, is his attribution of
most critical errors to <span lang="fr"><i>l’habitude choquée</i></span>:<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a> and though there is
both exaggeration and undue restriction in saying that
“Romanticism is the art of giving people themselves pleasure,
Classicism that of giving them what pleased their grandfathers,”<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a>
we know what he means. He is very sound on taste
and fashion; and his severity on Voltaire is refreshing, because
it cannot be attributed, as it is the fashion to attribute severities
on that patriarch, to the <span lang="la"><i>odium theologicum</i></span>. The whole, even
in its singularities and shortcomings, is an invaluable testimony
to the set of the current at the time:<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a> but its words are not
lightly to be taken as other than “words to the wise,” and they
are not invariably the words <em>of</em> the wise.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.53'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His attitude here</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Beyle’s attitude in this tract has been commented on in a
fashion very illuminative (if you apply the proper checks in each
case) by two persons of unsurpassed competence, but not of
quite unsurpassed disinterestedness, Mérimée and Sainte-Beuve.
The former<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> says plumply, <span lang="fr">“Pour lui la poésie était lettre close,”</span>
and quotes the famous <span lang="fr"><i>boutade</i></span> in <span lang="fr"><cite>De l’Amour</cite></span>, that “Verse was
invented as an aid to memory.” His objection, says his disciple,
to Racine (who “met with his sovereign displeasure”) was
that he had no character or local colour: his reasons of preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>for Shakespeare, that poet’s knowledge of the human
heart, the life and individuality of his characters, his
command of the nicest shades of passion and sentiment.
Sainte-Beuve, on his side,<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a> affects rather to
pooh-pooh the whole matter, as if it were a battle of kites and
crows, where the blood (if any) has been long absorbed, the torn
feathers blown away, and the dust settled to quietness. Beyle
was a fairly early, but excited and not quite judicious partaker
in it. He was unjust to La Harpe (Sainte-Beuve defending La
Harpe is rather good!), too much on the side of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> (this is better,<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a> the “Blue and Yellow” as a Romantic
organ!). One remembers, of course, at once that both these
great men of letters were, if not exactly deserters and traitors
in regard to Romanticism, at any rate Romantics whose first
love had grown pretty cold. Yet we must not forget to notice
that Sainte-Beuve practically confirms Mérimée on Beyle’s
“exclusion of poetry” in judging even Shakespeare.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.54'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and elsewhere.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nor do we need these great accuser-compurgators. The
singular self-revelations which have been communicated so
lavishly of late years, tell us, sometimes on every page, sometimes
at longer, but never at very long, intervals, of Beyle’s
abiding interest in literature, and of its curious character,
Most part of the letters<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a> which he, as little more than a <a id='corr138.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='boy.'>boy,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.23'><ins class='correction' title='boy.'>boy,</ins></a></span>
wrote to his younger sister, Pauline, is occupied with
literary and educational advice, nearly as surprising
in its meticulous and affectionate pedagogism as the
writer’s almost contemporary <cite>Journal</cite> is in very different ways.
In both, and elsewhere, we find the ever-growing passion for
Shakespeare, from the dramatic and psychological side, the ever-growing
distaste for Racine, the admiration of Corneille, and
the contempt of Voltaire—the latter an excellent subject for
separate and careful study, inasmuch as we have in it Beyle’s
Romanticism engaging and overcoming his anti-religiosity.
Among the most curious documents noted here—where I
think I have noted some that are curious—is the letter to
Pauline of May 12, 1807, from Berlin, where Beyle has just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>discovered <span lang="fr"><cite>Lenore</cite></span> “across the veil which covers the genius of
the German tongue from” him, and thinks it very touching.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed Beyle in point of criticism is <em>polypidax</em>: though the
streams are, as it were, underground for the most part, they
gush out in the most apparently unlikely places. I have dozens
of noted passages, for instance, in that singular and most readable
book the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires d’un Touriste</cite></span>,<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> certainly not a probable
title-source of our matter, and some even in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Promenades
dans Rome</cite></span>. He resembled Hazlitt in the way in which his
criticism was liable to be distorted and poisoned by extra-literary
prejudice, more particularly of the anti-clerical kind.
I never knew a man so tormented with the idea of something
in which he did not—or said he did not—believe, as Beyle is
with the idea of Hell. It sometimes makes him very nearly
silly, and constantly makes him lose occasions of combined
magnanimity and pure literary judgment, as wherever he speaks
of Joseph de Maistre.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a> But, as in Hazlitt’s case also, you
seldom or never find a literary judgment of Beyle’s, free from
prejudice, which is not sound.</p>

<a id='sec7.4.55'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Nodier.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For those who like <span lang="fr"><cite>Vitae Parallelae</cite></span>, with a spice, or more
than a spice, of contrast, Nodier<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a> makes an excellent pendant
to Beyle: and while his influence was much more
rapid, it was wider also, if not deeper. Nodier
began his romantic and “xenomaniac” excursions with the
century, writing on Shakespeare in 1801 and on Goethe in 1802.
I have chased in the catalogues, but without bagging, a collection
of early reviews of his, published by Barginet of Grenoble
in 1822, which ought to be of very considerable interest for
our purpose. It is well known how, especially after his
appointment to the librarianship of the Arsenal in 1823, his
abode became a rallying-place, and he himself a sort of Nestor-Ulysses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of Romanticism, while his delightful fantastic, or half-fantastic
stories (the best of them to my thinking is <span lang="fr"><cite>Inès de las
Sierras</cite></span>), which are Sterne <em>plus</em> Hoffmann <em>plus</em> something else,
form no small part of the choicest outcome of the movement.
But in criticism proper, Nodier, though a great propelling and
inspiring force, has left rather inadequate recorded examples
of this force in application. This is partly due to the fact
that his intense interest in pure bibliography, and in the
“curiosities of literature,” drew him, as similar interests have
often drawn others, a little away from that severer altar on
which burns the fire of pure literary and critical appreciation.
His principal book of this kind, perhaps his principal non-creative
work, <span lang="fr"><cite>Mélanges tirés d’une Petite Bibliothèque</cite></span>,<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a> shows
this very clearly: and it may rather be feared that Nodier
would have preferred a perfectly worthless book, of which he
possessed an unique copy, or an extremely eccentric one, of
which hardly anybody had ever heard, to the greatest work
which everybody knew and had on their shelves. But still he
did like much of the best of what was known, and, fortunately,
directed his liking most to that of the best which was not so
well known as it ought to be. And so there are few more
characteristic names—and few names of more power—than his
in the French Transition.</p>

Saint-Germain, dated “1770-26/2.” The

there noticed. It is of little intrinsic
importance,  being a mere treatise on
“Composition”—a common-sense and
common-place <cite>Rhetoric</cite> adjusted to late
French eighteenth century standards.
Its definition of style as depending on

some interesting reviews, especially
that of February 1819 on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Annales

<span lang="fr"><cite>Défense et Illustration</cite></span> of the Romantic
outburst. But I do not know that
the early pieces on English literature
dating from the last year of the eighteenth
century, are not as important.
In these the writer, either from policy
(for though he had a friendly editor in
Fontanes, he was writing under the
eyes of Bonaparte’s police) or really
imperfect conversion, approximates
much more to the “dunghill-and-pearl”
view of Shakspere than the innocent
might think likely, and has not quite
reached his future state (<i>v. inf.</i>) of
illumination as to <cite>Ossian</cite>. He is very
severe on Young, and has a very
curious passage on the English view of
the subject at the moment, which is
probably not far from the truth, and
at any rate helps us to understand the
half-way-house attitude of men like
Jeffrey and Campbell. The Queen Anne
men, we are told, were at a discount—Richardson
was little read, Hume and
Gibbon were thought gallicisers, and so
forth. But these things are at best
useful sidelights on their author’s position

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec7.5.1'></a><div class='sidenote side15'><i>The present chapter itself a kind of excursus.</i></div>
<p class='c025'>It was announced at the very opening of this History that it
would not deal, except incidentally and under <span lang="fr"><i>force majeure</i></span>,
with those vaguer problems of general Criticism or
metacriticism which, during the last two centuries,
have taken the general name of Æsthetics. <a id='sec7.5.2'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>A parabasis on “philosophical” criticism.</i></span> But
some of my critics have not been content with this
announcement, and it is perhaps permissible in this place to
notice certain exceptions which have been taken to the absence
of—or rather to the pretty definite abstention from—“philosophical”
discussions and speculations in
this book. For while in Italy I have been pronounced
<span lang="it"><i>digiuno di filosofia</i></span>, the huntsmen have
been up in America against my “confusion of thought”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and my writing about Criticism without defining what criticism
is.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the first point, I may perhaps be allowed to say that
“divine Philosophy” has been by no means such a stranger or
stepmother to me as some of my critics seem to suppose. I
have duly sojourned in her courts, and have found them the
reverse of unamiable: I have eaten of her bread and found
it both palatable and nourishing. But it is Philosophy herself
who teaches us, by the mouth of not her least but, as
some have thought, her greatest exponent, not to shift or mix
the Kinds. And, to my possibly heretical judgment, the “kind”
of Criticism seems one into which such “general ideas” as my
critics desiderate can only be introduced by a most doubtful
and perilous naturalisation. I suppose it would be generally
granted that no “philosophical” critics stand higher than Plato
and Coleridge: Aristotle himself has, in comparison with them,
but contented himself with middle axioms and empirical observation.
And the result of this is that—again to my
possibly heretical thinking—Plato has actually left us nothing
in pure criticism but an often mischievous theory:
while Coleridge is just so much the more barren in true
criticism as he expatiates further in the regions of sheer
“philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor should I, if I chose to take up the quarrel, in the least
lack other arms or armour of offence and defence, sufficiently
proofmarked by Philosophy herself. I hold that the province of
Philosophy is occupied by matters of the pure intellect: and
that literary criticism is busied with matters which, though not
in the loosest meaning, are matters of sense. I do not know—and
I do not believe that any one knows, however much he
may juggle with terms—why certain words arranged in certain
order stir one like the face of the sea, or like the face of a
girl, while other arrangements leave one absolutely indifferent
or excite boredom or dislike. I know that we may generalise
a little; may “push our ignorance a little farther back”;
may discover some accordances of sound, some rhythmical adjustments,
some cunning and more or less constant appeals to
eye and ear which, as we coolly say, “explain” emotion and attraction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to some extent. But <em>why</em> these general things delight
man he knows no more than, in his more unsophisticated stage,
why their individual cases and instances do so. I do not
think that my own doctrine of the Poetic (or the literary)
Moment—of the instant and mirific “kiss of the spouse”—is
so utterly “unphilosophical”: but I do know that that
doctrine, if it does not exactly laugh to scorn theories of
æsthetic, makes them merely facultative indulgences. And
just as physiology, and biology, and all the ’ologies that ever
were ’ologied, leave you utterly uninformed as to the real
reason of the rapture of the physical kiss, so I think that
æsthetics do not teach the reason of the amorous peace of
the Poetic Moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I began this book with no intention of writing a
treatise on <em>Momentary</em> (or <em>Monochronous</em>) <em>Apolaustics</em>, and except
that it might have seemed discourteous to offer no explanation
of (I can hardly call this any apology for) a feature, or the lack
of one, which has disturbed well-willing readers, I should
have preferred to keep such questions out altogether. Nor
can I see that there is any “confusion of thought,” any contradiction,
or even any want of “architectonic” in the plan
which I have actually pursued. A man may surely write a
<i>History of England</i> without including in it an abstract treatise
on politics, and describe an interesting country without philosophising
on the architecture of its buildings, the family story
of its tribes, or the chemical constitution of its natural products.
I set before myself and my readers at the outset the promise
of a simple survey of the actual critical opinions, actually expressed,
in “judging of authors,” by the actual critics of recorded
literature. To the survey of these I have added another
of the chief reasons which they alleged for their tastes when
they alleged any: and when, as naturally happens, these
opinions and tastes, and the attempted explanations of them,
appeared in groups or schools, I have adapted my survey, by
means of the Interchapters of the book, to the summary consideration
of these also. I have not thought it incumbent
on me either to express, or to refrain from expressing,
agreement or disagreement with their views: but where (as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>in the case of the Subject theory, of Boileau’s Good-Sense-worship
and other things) it seemed to me that certain views
and theories could be actually demolished by argument, I
have endeavoured to show how. Where it is a simple question
of taste, my own <span lang="fr"><i>Haupt-theorie</i></span> forbids my attempting anything
of the sort.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am, I confess, unable to see that either Logic or Architectonic
is outraged by this preannounced and methodical limitation
of proceeding. I have given, or attempted to give, my
“Atlas” of the actual facts with what accuracy and clearness
I could. The complement of Theory I do not pretend to
supply, and I cannot see that anybody has a right to demand
it. Whoso wants to take it let him make it: my facts ought
to help him in the making, and if they do not, he and not the
facts must bear the blame. This book has attempted to provide,
in an orderly arrangement, and, as far as might be in the
space, exhaustively, what has called itself and has been called
Criticism (certain varieties being, for reasons given, excluded
or less fully treated) from the beginnings of Greek literature,
as we have them, to the present day. Of these provisions I
think I may say—without prejudice to any further use of
them that any one may choose to make—<span lang="la"><i>his utere mecum</i></span>:
and I will just add that had anybody offered me the same
provision thirty years ago, I should have been profoundly
thankful, and have been spared many a weary hour of gleaning
here and groping there.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall even be so very bold as to say that what I have
actually done, or attempted to do, seems to me in the true
sense both <em>philosophoteron</em> and <em>spoudaioteron</em> than what my
censors would have liked me to do. Any tolerably clever
undergraduate, reading for Greats, could sketch (in after-life
amusing himself, and perhaps impressing others, by accumulating
arguments in support, or in destruction, of his undergraduate
hypothesis) explanations of the distaste of the ancients for
“appreciative” criticism, of the critical silence of the Middle
Ages, of the French and English attitude of sixteenth-seventeenth
century criticism and sixteenth-seventeenth century
creation, of the time of bondage to Good Sense, of the avatars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and phases of Taste. I would undertake myself to make a
complete set in a Long Vacation, with arguments <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>
in the “best and most orgilous” manner. But I should not believe
one of them, and I should mutter <span lang="la"><i>O vix sancta simplicitas!</i></span>
if anybody were taken in by them. In what I have given
there is no possibility of taking in, and no need to believe or
disbelieve. Here are the simple facts, disengaged by a certain
amount of hard labour from their more or less accessible sources
and quarries, and ranged, whether ill or well, yet at any rate
with some system, and in such a fashion that they must be
reasonably easy to master. I may not be an architect, but
think I may claim to be a tolerable quarryman and a purveyor
of the stone in fairly convenient arrangement, workably
rough-hewed. And your most gifted architect will find himself
put to it to make his Beauvais or his Batalha, his Salisbury
or his Strasburg, from stone unquarried or unshaped to his
hand. I have, in short, endeavoured to give a tolerably complete
collection of facts which have never been collected before.
If my facts are inconvenient to any philosophy, so much the
worse for it: if they are convenient, let it take them and
welcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>At any rate—with what results of success or failure, of
advantage or disadvantage to the work, the reader, not the
writer, must judge,—my initial undertaking of abstinence
has, I think, been fairly discharged. The point, however, at
which we have arrived is one of those where the <span lang="fr"><i>force majeure</i></span>
makes itself felt. In the Book where we aim at exhibiting
the process of change which is so noticeable as between the
general criticism of the eighteenth and the general criticism
of the nineteenth centuries, and at examining to some extent
the causes of that change, we could not possibly omit an
influence so powerful for good or for evil as that of the constitution—as
a regular branch of philosophy—of inquiries into
the principles of Beauty, into the æsthetic sense, into the
psychological aspects of the appeal of art generally. We shall
still deal in the most economical and temperate fashion with
these matters: but we cannot here abstain from them entirely.
Indeed it might be open to anybody to urge that large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>passages occurring elsewhere in this volume, and even to
some extent in the last, properly belong to the present
chapter—that Lessing, Diderot, Du Bos are strayed sheep of
this fold. But one remarkable person in France, another in
Italy, and two still more remarkable groups in Germany and
England, will find better place here than anywhere for something
like individual notice: and others must be at least the
subject of reference and glance.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Modern Æsthetics: their fount in Descartes and its branches.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With the minor differences which, occurring in all matters
of opinion, nowhere multiply so fast and subdivide themselves
so minutely as in questions of philosophy, there has
been of late a general agreement to trace the germ
of the modern division of Æsthetics to Descartes.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
To discuss this at any length would be quite improper
here: but no one who has the least acquaintance
with the Cartesian philosophy can fail to see how
naturally—nay, how inevitably—both the general principle
of that philosophy in its reduction and rallying of everything
to conditions of abstract idea and thought, and its particular
insistence on clearness of definition and the like in Method,
should lead to a reconsideration and further exploration of
the idea of Beauty, literary and other. There is also no doubt
that, in the next generation or generations, the developments
of Cartesianism and the revolts against it might, nay, must,
affect powerfully these applications of abstract thought to the
remoter principles of literature. We have seen that Locke in
England, Philistine as he himself was in regard to letters, and
especially to poetry, had a very strong influence upon Addison,—an
influence which he continued to exercise, both through
Addison and independently, almost throughout the English
eighteenth century. There is no doubt that in France the
Père André, whom we shall mention presently, was a direct
descendant of Descartes through Malebranche. In Italy the
singular and solitary figure of Vico, though it exercised at
first no influence, has been claimed as having a new and
powerful influence to exercise in this direction as in others.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>And it is not disputable that Descartes begat Leibnitz or
that Leibnitz begat Wolff, to whose philosophical system
almost all competent judgment agrees in tracing the direct
origin of German æsthetic, in Breitinger, in Baumgarten,
and the rest.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.4'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>In Germany: negative as well as positive inducements.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is, I think, Herr von Antoniewicz, the very learned and
able editor of J. E. Schlegel, who accounts<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a> for the strong
abstract and æsthetic tendency of German eighteenth-century
criticism, both then and since, by the fact
that the originators of it had nothing to look back
upon, nothing to “tie themselves on to,” and that
they therefore struck out into the deep, <span lang="la"><i>ripæ ulterioris amore</i></span>,
as we may say, to tag his saying. This is ingenious, and it
becomes more illuminative when we compare the facts with
the corresponding facts in English criticism. We, too, though
we had in Dryden and Jonson a good deal more than the
Germans had, possessed little critical starting-point. But we
had, what the Germans had not, abundance of really great
writers upon whom to fix practical and real critical examinations.
It is half pathetic and half ludicrous to see the efforts
that Bodmer and Gottsched and their contemporaries make
to provide themselves with subjects of the kind out of people
like Besser and Neukirch and Amthor, like Lohenstein and
Hofmanswaldau, even like the excellent Opitz: and we cannot
wonder that they, or at least others, dropped off these unsucculent
subjects into the pure inane. But the fairer Callipolis
of English criticism could feed and grow fat on Chaucer, and
Spenser, and Shakespeare, and Milton, and Dryden always, and
by degrees on all the recovered wealth of older English literature.
The Germans had nothing (save Luther and a few more
not of the absolutely first class or even a very high second) but
that mediæval literature and those ballads which naturally they
did not reach at once. And even these, much good as they
did them, had not the inestimable <em>alterative</em> value of older as
compared with newer English literature.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Baumgarten.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, they had, as we have said, an unconquerable
desire and a dogged determination to learn and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>improve themselves: the very poverty of their own literature
drove them to compare and abstract others; and
they possessed, in the Wolffian philosophy, a strong
and serviceable instrument of method. Breitinger, with whom
we have dealt sufficiently in his general critical aspect, may
perhaps have the credit of the first distinct and extensive
attempt to busy himself with the theory of art and letters:
to Baumgarten is always attributed that of having put the
name “Æsthetic” into currency, and of having got the thing—if
it may be called a thing—into formal and regular shape.
He used the word in a thesis, <span lang="la"><cite>De Nonnullis ad Poema Pertinentibus</cite></span>,<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
as early as 1735, about midway between the time
when the Zürich men turned their attention seriously to
poetry and imagination in the abstract, and the issue of their
main body of work in 1740-41. But it was not till fifteen
years later, at the exact middle of the century, that he began
to publish his <span lang="la"><cite>Æsthetica</cite></span>,<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c010'><sup>[260]</sup></a> redacted from lectures delivered in
the interval.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.6'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><span lang="la">De Nonnullis ad Poema Pertinentibus</span>,</div>

<p class='c001'>The thesis itself is to the expert a sufficient announcement
of the new departure, which of course is only an old one re-fashioned.
Baumgarten takes us right back to the
most abstract criticism of the Italian Renaissance—the
“idea of a poem,” the skeleton of poetic
thought, method, expression, strung together by a
new science of the sense of beauty. A poem is <span lang="la"><i>oratio sensitiva
perfecta</i></span>. What is poetical is that which contributes to this
perfection.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and its definition of poetry</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The most fatal, and I am sure the most unintentionally fatal,
criticism of Baumgarten, and incidentally of the entire division
of critical or quasi-critical literature to which his
work belongs, is contained in a remark of Herr
Braitmaier’s (ii. 9) that part of the thesis “is written
with very little understanding of poetry.” The question is
whether the whole is not—whether this and other things
like it might not have been said by a man who could not
distinguish between Tupper and Tennyson, between Hugo and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Delille. Look at this <span lang="la"><i>oratio sensitiva perfecta</i></span>—which sent the
good Herder into ecstasies as a new poetic spell, germ, and
what not. Like other abstract definitions, including that of
Coleridge himself, to which we shall come later, it omits or
misses the <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span> of Poetry altogether. It lets in the
prose-poetry or the prose-better-than-poetry heretics by
a wide and unclosable door:<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a> it excludes the very quality
which some of those who love poetry most love in it. What
is “perfection” but the attainment, in the highest degree, of
that which is elsewhere attained in degrees high, less high,
low, or lowest? There are therefore <span lang="la"><i>orationes sensitivæ</i></span> which
have the qualities of poetry but are not poetry. This is hard
to admit. Poetry should be itself: not a “bestment” of something
else.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Aletheophilus.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the <span lang="la"><cite>Aletheophilus</cite></span>, which followed (1741), Baumgarten
expanded and, at the same time, condescended a little. A
poem is now a “lively” oration instead of “sensitive”
words, and so lively that it demands metrical
expression. Herein he seems to his severer critics to have
derogated. “Liveliness,” they say, was in <span lang="la"><i>sensitiva</i></span>, only better:
<span lang="fr">“metre”</span> was in <span lang="la"><i>perfecta</i></span> by implication. One can only say that
<em>we</em> prefer to take it explicitly. And Baumgarten, like all
other theorists with hardly an exception, grudges the admission
of metre after all. He calculates that it gives only a very
small proportion of the charm of poetry. True, the admission
of it at all—with the further prescription of “thoughts that
burn,” “brilliant order,” “regular,” that is to say, pure, neatly
adjusted, adequate, and charming “expression,” does something
to dress up the bare skeleton of the <span lang="la"><i>perfecta sensitiva oratio</i></span>.
But it does more to show what a bodiless skeleton it is. <a id='sec7.5.9'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The</i> Æsthetica.</span> The
<span lang="la"><cite>Æsthetica</cite></span> itself,<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a> which had been preceded by a
sort of pilot-engine in the shape of a redaction of
Baumgarten’s professorial lectures by his pupil, G. F. Meier,<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>expands, after a rather Vossian pattern, the principles of the
two earlier books, dwelling much on “perfection,” on the
innate disposition of the soul towards beautiful thoughts, and
the like. He is perhaps most justly thanked for his insistence
on <span lang="la"><i>sensitiva</i></span>—on the sensual as well as intellectual appeal of
poetry. But his illustration from actual ancient poetry is
not rich: and that from modern almost non-existent.<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c010'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To Baumgarten we have given some place as to a pioneer
even in a branch of criticism which we do not intend to
pursue. His followers, Sulzer and Eberhard, must have less
room, and Moses Mendelssohn, between them, is elsewhere
treated.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sulzer.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The well-known <span lang="de"><cite>Allgemeine Theorie der Schönen Künste</cite></span><a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c010'><sup>[265]</sup></a> of

belong as supplement, is in reality a painful compound
of Dictionary and Bibliography, wherein you
go from <span lang="de"><cite>Copiren</cite></span> to <span lang="de"><cite>Corinthische Ordnung</cite></span>, and from <span lang="de"><cite>Menuet</cite></span> to
<span lang="de"><cite>Metalepsis</cite></span>. Such things, invaluable for their time, are almost
necessarily thrown into the wallet at his back by Time himself.
But they serve as a text for a repetition of the sober truth
that the immense reputation and the really solid achievement
of Germany since have been not a little due to the provision
of them by her eighteenth-century <a id='corr150.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='writers'>writers.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_150.23'><ins class='correction' title='writers'>writers.</ins></a></span> Mere knowledge
will not do everything: and it is peculiarly liable to degenerate
into a simple rag-bag and marine-store accumulation of things
that are <em>not</em> knowledge. But the average man can do very
little without it; he can sometimes do quite surprising things
with it. And while the less than average man is without it
mainly negligible, it would be wofully easy to provide examples
in which persons, certainly or possibly much above the average
in ability, have made shipwreck by neglecting it.</p>

to them are of the most meagre character. There must be
Unity: and the poet must please the imagination (Addison had
at least taught them to use the word) as well as the intellect.
Even “pleasure” is to be used with jealous care as a criterion
of Beauty—the love of this is to be “disinterested.” But
beyond these vague, as one might have thought barren, and
in the last case theoretical generalities, André has next to
nothing for the student of Literary Criticism, who may make
what he can of the table of the Beautiful, as—</p>

<a id='sec7.5.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Italy: Vico.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In Italy, the illustrious author<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a> of the <span lang="it"><cite>Scienza Nuova</cite></span><a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a> had,
before Baumgarten, before even Breitinger, and long before
André, turned the powers of his profound and
original thought to the question of <span lang="it"><i>sapienza poetica</i></span>.
He lays at least as much stress as Baumgarten himself upon
the <span lang="la"><i>sensitiva</i></span>: discerns natural and diametrical opposition
between Metaphysics and Poetry; but still admits a Science,
“new” in this as in other respects, of Poetry, or at least a
<span lang="la"><i>logica poetica</i></span> which compares curiously with Breitinger’s “Logic
of Imagination” and other things. There does not appear to
be any suspicion or any likelihood of indebtedness: it is only
one of the innumerable instances of things being “in the air”
and of the birds of the air carrying them to different places
and persons. With him, poetry, like everything else, is an
item or factor in human <em>history</em>, though, following his strong
metaphysical turn, he deals largely with the relations to soul
and sense, &#38;c.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His literary places.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In arranging, according to our usual fashion, the actual
deliverances of Vico as actually presented, we find them in
four successive places presenting as many stages of
his thought—the <span lang="la"><cite>De Studiorum Ratione</cite></span> (1708), the
<span lang="la"><cite>Constantia Jurisprudentis</cite></span> (1721), the first <span lang="it"><cite>Scienza</cite></span> (1725), and
the second (1730).</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span></div>
<a id='sec7.5.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="la">De Studiorum Ratione.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>The first named is early, and it presents the author’s thought
in a somewhat embryonic condition, but as true to the future
development as an embryo ought to be. Its importance
for us consists first in the starting<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a> from
Bacon, which of itself will give us something of
an inkling of Vico’s attitude to literature, though the Italian
fortunately discarded whatever was contemptuous or hostile
in the Englishman’s position. More important still is the
erection<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a> of a <span lang="la">“Nova Critica”</span> which is opposed and preferred
to <span lang="la">“Topica”</span> in relation to literature itself. <span lang="la">“Critica est ars
veræ orationis; Topica</span> [here evidently used in one of the
full senses of ‘Rhetoric’] <span lang="la">autem copiosæ.”</span><a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a> And most, the
paragraph<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c010'><sup>[273]</sup></a> on Poetry itself, where Vico, deserting Bacon, proclaims
it not a <span lang="la"><i>vinum dæmonum</i></span> but a “gift of the Most
Highest,” declares the great characteristic of the Poet to be
Imagination, but (true to his own line) insists on Truth being
still most necessary to him. That the new Physic will be
very convenient to Poetry by supplying it with fresh and
accurate images may raise a smile: but after all it has not
proved quite vain.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="la">De Constantia Jurisprudentis</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la"><cite>De Constantia Jurisprudentis</cite></span> may seem a surprising title;
but Vico was thoroughly of the opinion of a later jurist,
Mr Counsellor Paulus Pleydell, about the necessity
of “history and literature” to his profession, and the
sub-title <span lang="la"><cite>De Constantia Philologiæ</cite></span> takes away even
the titular shock. Philology is here no mere charwoman,
with  the  charwoman’s  too  frequent  habit  of  doing
even the mean work she does badly; but a mighty goddess of
knowledge, presiding over not merely the history of words
but the history of things. History was Vico’s real darling:
and that view of poetry as the earliest attainable history,
which, true enough in a way, was to lead him into heresy
afterwards, distinctly appears here. It is only at the twelfth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>chapter of this section<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a> that he comes to talk <span lang="la">“De Linguæ
Heroicæ sive de Poeseos Origine,”</span> and handles his subject
very much as we should expect from his text, that “Poetry
is the first language of men.” Still, he goes into a good deal
of detail, and his description<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a> of the iamb as the “middleman”
(<span lang="la"><i>tradux</i></span>) between heroic verse and prose, though not likely to
be historically correct, has a certain truth logically. And he
appends to this, in a very long note, a discussion of Homer
himself, which is not yet polytheist.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The first</i> <span lang="it">Scienza Nuova</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>These earlier treatises take away almost all oddity from the
appearance in the first <span lang="it"><cite>Scienza</cite></span> of an entire Book,<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a> the Third,
occupied with New Principles of Poetry.  Hotch-potch
as this book may seem—ranging as it does
from theogony to chronology, and from both to
heraldry and the science of medals, from elaborate discussions
of “fables” generally to a discovery of the Laws of War
and Peace in poetry itself, from the greatness of Homer to
the truth of the Christian Religion,—all these apparent oddities
are waxed if not welded together by Vico’s general idea of the
Poet as the earliest and truest historian, philosopher, and
authority for the New Science of Humanity. Indeed he often
reminds us of Shelley in the <cite>Defence of Poetry</cite>, and I daresay
Shelley really knew him.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.5.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Second.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is not, however, till the second <span lang="it"><cite>Scienza</cite></span> that these sketches
and studies take the form of an elaborate treatise, <span lang="it"><cite>Della
Sapienza Poetica</cite></span>, filling one whole book on the
general subject, and another, <span lang="it"><cite>Della Discoverta del
Vero Omero</cite></span>, no less than three hundred pages.<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a> Here Vico
becomes more than ever “Thorough.” After preliminaries on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>science generally, on poetical science, and on the Deluge, we
have a Metaphysic of Poetry, a Logic of Poetry, an Ethic,
Economic, Politic, Physic (specified down as Cosmography,
Astronomy, Chronology, and Geography)—all of Poetry!</p>

<p class='c001'>In these bold speculations many striking and really critical
sayings occur. That it is the first principle of poetry to give
life, and its own life, to everything<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c010'><sup>[279]</sup></a> nobody need deny; nor
that poetry is at once “impossible and credible,”<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c010'><sup>[280]</sup></a> a near
coasting of the Coleridgean Land of Promise, the explorer
starting of course, as Coleridge did, from the Aristotelian doctrine
of the “plausible impossible” and the absurdity rendered
imperceptible by poetic speech. That “too much reflection
hurts poetry”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c010'><sup>[281]</sup></a> is less unmixedly true, though most certainly
not unmixedly false.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Rationale of all this.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>All this is extremely interesting, but with an interest so
different from that of purely literary criticism that I can quite
understand how a man like Signor Croce, taking
his start from it, ostracises purely literary criticism
itself. Of this last indeed<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c010'><sup>[282]</sup></a> there is little or nothing in Vico.
He does not conduct—I am not aware of any one who ever
<em>has</em> conducted—the argument for Homeric disintegration on
literary grounds: his occasional comparisons of Dante with
Homer are equally unliterary. I have not yet found a place
where he deals with any author in a purely literary spirit.
The zeal of his New Science of Humanity has eaten him up.
A poem is a historical document, a poet is not merely an
early historian but an early theologian, philosopher, jurist,
moralist, panto-pragmatist, <em>panepistemon</em>, <em>panhistor</em>. Very
like; but for most of these purposes a Tupper would be quite
as valuable as a Tennyson, and we see that a cloud of unsubstantial
Homerids were quite as valuable to Vico as the One
Poet of Helen and Nausicaa, of Achilles and Odysseus.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>A very great man and thinker, but in pure Criticism an influence malign or null.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For us, therefore, the main importance of Vico, though undoubtedly
great, is of a dubious not to say a sinister character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>It establishes him in a position by no means dissimilar to
that of Plato,—a position of enormous influence,
epoch-making and original, which influence has
chiefly spent itself in ways outside of, or counter
to, that which we are pursuing. If Vico had contented
himself with developing, in the direction of
literature, the theory of cyclical progression which
he in common with other great thinkers held, and
if he had had literary knowledge enough to apply it, the
results might have been wholly good. But it does not appear
that he had this knowledge, and, whether he had it or not, he
used what he had in very different lines. I think that Professor
Flint has established beyond all doubt Vico’s claim to
the anticipation of the so-called “Wolfian” method with
Homer.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c010'><sup>[283]</sup></a> But, as I have explained from the very outset, this
so-called criticism also is not the species of criticism with which
we here busy ourselves at all: and its methods are entirely
separate and partly hostile. Yet there is no question about
the importance which this so-called criticism has assumed in
the last two centuries, and in this, as in other matters, Vico
is an origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>So is he, I think, likewise in the extension of literary criticism
by including in it investigations into psychology, not merely
individual but national, into manners, religion, and what not.
This extension, continued by the Germans of the later
eighteenth century and immensely popularised and developed
during the nineteenth, of course now seems to some the
orthodox and only legitimate process of the kind. To me, as
my readers by this time must be well aware, it does not
seem so. I therefore deplore the exercise of Vico’s genius in
this direction, and I do not purpose to admit its results into
these pages more than I can help. But once more I recognise
his greatness, if in some respects as that of a great heresiarch.
And it would be really “unphilosophical” to leave him without
pointing out, what has not, so far as I know, been pointed out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>before, how noteworthy he is as exemplifying the corruption of
a thing accompanying quite early stages of its growth. We
have throughout maintained that the Historical method is the
salvation of Criticism, and in this very period we are witnessing
its late application to that purpose. Vico is the very apostle,
nay, more, the prophet, of the Historical method itself. Yet
here, as elsewhere, the postern to Hell is hard by the gateway
of the Celestial City.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>England.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We may give a somewhat full account of some English
writers whose criticism trembles on the verge of æsthetic or
oversteps it, partly on the general principles announced
in the preface to the last volume, partly
because some of them at least do touch actual criticism rather
more nearly than, say, Baumgarten and Vico; but also
because, in the great <em>prepollence</em> of English literature during
the eighteenth century, some of them likewise—notably Shaftesbury
and Burke—exercised a very considerable influence upon
foreign countries. As for Hume, he is a particularly interesting
example of a man pushing freedom of thought to the
utmost limit in certain directions, but apparently content to
dwell in the most hide-bound orthodoxy of his time as to
others.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c010'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.5.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Shaftesbury.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There are few writers of whom more different opinions have
been held, in regard to their philosophical and literary value,
than is the case with Shaftesbury. His criticism
has been less discussed, except from the purely
philosophical or at any rate the technically æsthetic side; but
difference is scarcely less certain here when discussion does
take place. It is difficult to put the dependence of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>difference in an uncontentious and non-question-begging
manner, because it concerns a fundamental antinomy of the
fashion in which this curious author strikes opposite temperaments.
To some, every utterance of his seems to carry with
it in an undertone something of this sort: “I am not merely
a Person of Quality, and a very fine gentleman, but also, look
you, a philosopher of the greatest depth, though of the most
elegant exterior, and a writer of consummate originality and
<span lang="it"><i>agudeza</i></span>. If you are sensible people you will pay me the
utmost respect; but alas! there are so many vulgar and insensible
people about, that very likely you will not.” Now
this kind of “air” abundantly fascinates some readers, and
intrigues others; while, to yet others again, it seems the
affectation, most probably of a charlatan, certainly of an
intellectual coxcomb, and they are offended accordingly. It
is probably unjust (though there is weighty authority for it) to
regard Shaftesbury as a charlatan; but he will hardly, except
by the fascination aforesaid or by some illegitimate partisanship
of religious or philosophical view, escape the charge of being
a coxcomb; and his coxcombry appears nowhere more than in
his dealings with criticism.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c010'><sup>[285]</sup></a> From the strictest point of view
of our own definition of the art, he would have very little
right to entrance here at all, and would have to be pretty
unceremoniously treated if he were allowed to take his trial.
His concrete critical utterances—his actual appreciations—are
almost Rymerical; with a modish superciliousness substituted
for pedantic scurrility. “The British Muses,” quoth my lord,
in his <cite>Advice to an Author</cite>,<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c010'><sup>[286]</sup></a> “may well lie abject and obscure,
especially being as yet in their mere infant state. They have
scarce hitherto arrived to anything of stateliness or person,”
and he continues in the usual style with “wretched pun and
quibble,” “false sublime,” “Gothick mode of poetry,” “horrid
discord of jingling rhyme,” &#38;c. He speaks of “that noble
satirist Boileau” as “raised from the plain model of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>ancients.” Neither family affection, nor even family pride,
could have induced him to speak as he speaks of Dryden,<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c010'><sup>[287]</sup></a> if
he had had any real literary taste. His sneers at Universities,<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c010'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
at “pedantick learning,” at “the mean fellowship of bearded
boys,” deprive him of the one saving grace which Neo-classicism
could generally claim. “Had I been a Spanish
Cervantes, and with success equal to that comick author had
destroyed the reigning taste of Gothick or Moorish Chivalry,
I could afterwards contentedly have seen my burlesque itself
despised and set aside.”<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c010'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Perhaps there is not a more unhappily
selected single epithet in the whole range of criticism
than “the <em>cold</em> Lucretius.”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c010'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, both in the more speciously literary parts
of his desultory discourses <span lang="la"><cite>de quodam Ashleio</cite></span>, and outside of
them, he has frequent remarks on the Kinds;<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c010'><sup>[291]</sup></a> he is quite
copious on Correctness;<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c010'><sup>[292]</sup></a> and there can be no doubt that he
deserves his place in this chapter by the fashion in which he
endeavours to utilise his favourite <span lang="la"><i>pulchrum</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>honestum</i></span> in reference
to Criticism, of which he is a declared and (as far as his
inveterate affectation and mannerism will let him) an ingenious
defender. The main <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> for this is the Third Miscellany,
and its central, or rather culminating, passage<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c010'><sup>[293]</sup></a> occurs in
the second chapter thereof. The Beautiful is the principle of
Literature as well as of Virtue; the sense whereby it is apprehended
is Good Taste; the manner of attaining this taste is by a
gradual rejection of the excessive, the extravagant, the vulgar.<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c010'><sup>[294]</sup></a>
A vague enough gospel, and not over well justified by the fruits
of actual appreciation quoted above;<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c010'><sup>[295]</sup></a> but not perhaps much
vaguer, or possessing less justification, than most metacritic.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hume.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The position of Hume in regard to literary criticism has
an interest which would be almost peculiar if it were not
for something of a parallel in Voltaire. If the
literary opinions of the author of the <cite>Enquiry into
Human Nature</cite> stood alone they would be almost negligible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and if he had worked them into an elaborate treatise, like
that of his clansman Kames, this would probably, if remembered
at all, be remembered as a kind of “awful example.” In
their context and from their author, however, we cannot
quite “regard and pass” Hume’s critical observations as their
intrinsic merit may seem to suggest that we should do: nay,
in that context and from that author, they constitute a really
valuable document in more than one relation.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Examples of his critical opinions.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be said that Hume does not invite notice as a
critic; on the contrary, his title of “<i>Essays: Moral, Political,</i><a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c010'><sup>[296]</sup></a>
<a id='corr160.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>and Literary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_160.11'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>and Literary</ins></a></span>” seems positively to challenge it. Yet
his actual literary utterances are rather few, and
would be almost unimportant but for the considerations
just put. He tells us criticism is difficult;<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a> he applies<a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
(as Johnson did somewhat differently) Fontenelle’s remark
about “telling the hours”; he illustrates from Holland the
difference of excellence in commerce and in literature.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c010'><sup>[298]</sup></a> He
condemns—beforehand, and with the vigour and acuteness
which we should expect from him—the idea of attempting
to account for the existence of a particular poet at a particular
time and in a particular place.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c010'><sup>[299]</sup></a> He is shocked at the vanity,
at the rudeness, and at the loose language of the ancients.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c010'><sup>[300]</sup></a>
He approaches, as Tassoni<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c010'><sup>[301]</sup></a> and Perrault<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c010'><sup>[302]</sup></a> had approached,
one of the grand <span lang="la"><i>cruces</i></span> of the whole matter by making his
Sceptic urge that “<em>beauty</em> and worth are merely of a relative
nature, and consist of an agreeable sentiment produced by
an object on a particular mind”;<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c010'><sup>[303]</sup></a> but he makes no detailed
use or application whatever of this as regards literature.
His Essay on <cite>Simplicity and Refinement in Writing</cite><a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c010'><sup>[304]</sup></a> is psychology
rather than criticism, and he uses his terms in a
rather curious manner. At least, I myself find it difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to draw up any definitions of these qualities which will
make Pope the <span lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of justifiable Refinement, and
Lucretius that of Simplicity; Virgil and Racine the examples
of the happy mean in both; Corneille and Congreve excessive
in Refinement, and Sophocles and Terence excessive in
Simplicity.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c010'><sup>[305]</sup></a> The whole is, however, a good rationalising of
the “classical” principle; and is especially interesting as
noticing, with slight reproof, a tendency to too great “affectation
and conceit” both in France and England—faults for
which <em>we</em> certainly should not indict the mid-eighteenth
century. The Essay <cite>On Tragedy</cite> is more purely psychological
still. And though <cite>On the Standard of Taste</cite> is less open to
this objection, one cannot but see that it is Human Nature,
and not Humane Letters, in which Hume is really interesting
himself. The vulgar censure on the reference to Bunyan<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c010'><sup>[306]</sup></a>
is probably excessive; for it is at least not improbable that
Hume had never read a line of <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, and
was merely using the tinker’s name as a kind of type-counter.
But this very acceptance of a conventional judgment—acceptance
constantly repeated throughout the Essay—is almost
startling in context with the <span lang="de"><i>alleszermalmend</i></span> tendency of some
of its principles. A critic who says<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c010'><sup>[307]</sup></a> that “It is evident that
none of the rules of composition are fixed by reasonings <span lang="la"><i>a
priori</i></span>,” is in fact saying “Take away that bauble!” in regard
to Neo-classicism altogether; and though in the very same
page Hume repeats the orthodox cavils at Ariosto, while
admitting his charm on the next, having thus set up the idol
again, he proceeds once more to lop it of hands and feet and
tumble it off its throne by saying that “if things are found
to please, they cannot be faults; let the pleasure which they
produce be ever so unexpected and unaccountable.” The
most dishevelled of Romantics, in the reddest of waistcoats,
could say no more.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>In his remarks upon the qualifications and functions of
the critic, Hume’s anthropological and psychological mastery
is evident enough: but it is at least equally evident that his
actual taste in literature was in no sense spontaneous, original,
or energetic. In comparing him, say, with Johnson it is
not a little amusing to find his much greater acquiescence
in the conventional and traditional judgments. Indeed, towards
the end of his Essay<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c010'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Hume anticipates a later expression<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c010'><sup>[309]</sup></a>
of a perennial attitude of mind by declaring, “However I may
excuse the poet on account of the manners of his age, I never
can relish the composition,” and by complaining of the want
of “humanity and decency so conspicuous” even sometimes
in Homer and the Greek tragedies. That David, of all
persons, should fail to realise—he did <em>not</em> fail to perceive—that
the humanity of Homer <em>was</em> human and the decency
of Sophocles <em>was</em> decent, is indeed surprising.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His inconsistency.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Such things might at first sight not quite dispose one to
regret that, as he himself remarks,<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c010'><sup>[310]</sup></a> “the critics who have
had some tincture of philosophy” have been “few,”
for certainly those who have had more tincture
of philosophy than Hume himself have been far fewer. But,
as is usually the case,<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c010'><sup>[311]</sup></a> it is not the fault of philosophy at
all. For some reason, natural disposition, or want of disposition,
or even that necessity of clinging to <em>some</em> convention
which has been remarked in Voltaire himself, evidently made
Hume a mere “church-going bell”—pulled by the established
vergers, and summoning the faithful to orthodox worship—in
most of his literary utterances. Yet, as we have seen, he
could not help turning quite a different tune at times, though
he himself hardly knew it.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>At the close of Burke’s <cite>Essay</cite><a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c010'><sup>[312]</sup></a> he expressly declines “to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>consider poetry as it regards the Sublime and Beautiful more
at large”; but this “more” refers to the fact that
his Fifth Part had been given to the Power of
Words in exciting ideas of the kind. Most of
what he says on this head is Lockian discussion of simple
and compound, abstract and concrete, &#38;c., and of the connection
of words with images, as illustrated by the cases—so interesting
in one instance to the English, and in the other to the
whole, eighteenth century—of Blacklock the blind poet, and
Saunderson the blind mathematician. There is, however, a
not unacute contention<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c010'><sup>[313]</sup></a> against the small critics of that and
other times, that the exact analytical composition necessary
in a picture is not necessary in a poetic image. But one
may doubt whether this notion was not connected in his own
mind with the heresy of the “streaks of the tulip.”<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c010'><sup>[314]</sup></a> It serves
him, however, as a safeguard against the mere “imitation”
theory: and it brings (or helps to bring) him very near to a
just appreciation of the marvellous power of words as words.
His remarks on the grandeur of the phrase “the Angel of
the Lord” are as the shadow of a great rock in the weary
glare of the <span lang="de"><i>Aufklärung</i></span>, and so are those which follow on
Milton’s “universe of Death.” Nor is it a trifling thing that
he should have discovered the fact that “very polished
languages are generally deficient in Strength.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the earlier part there are interesting touches, such as
that of “<em>degrading</em>” the style of the <cite>Æneid</cite> into that of <cite>The
Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, which, curiously enough, occurs actually in a
defence of a taste for romances of chivalry<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c010'><sup>[315]</sup></a> and of the sea-coast
of Bohemia. Part I. sect. xv., on the effects of tragedy,
is almost purely ethical. In the parts—the best of the book—which
deal directly with the title subjects (Parts II. and III.),
an excellent demonstration<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c010'><sup>[316]</sup></a> is made of the utter absurdity
of that scheme of physical proportion which we formerly
laughed at:<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c010'><sup>[317]</sup></a> but the application, which might seem so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>tempting, to similar arbitrariness in judging of literature,
is not made. Still more remarkable is the scantiness of the
section on “The Beautiful in Sounds”<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c010'><sup>[318]</sup></a> which should have
brought the writer to our proper subject. Yet we can hardly
regret that he says so little of it when we read that astonishing
passage<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c010'><sup>[319]</sup></a> in which the great Mr Burke has “observed”
the affections of the body by Love, and has come to the
conclusion that “the head reclines something on one side;
the eyelids are more closed than usual, and the eyes roll gently
with an inclination towards the object; the mouth is a little
opened and the breath drawn slowly with now and then a
low sigh; the whole body is composed, and the hands fall
idly to the sides”—a sketch which I have always wished
to have seen carried into line by the ingenious pencil of
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c010'><sup>[320]</sup></a> A companion portrait of the
human frame under the influence of poetic afflatus, in writer
or in reader, would indeed have been funny, but scarcely
profitable. In fact, the most that can be said for Burke, as
for the generality of these æsthetic writers, is that the speculations
recommended and encouraged could not but break
up the mere ice of Neo-classic rule-judgment. They almost
always go directly to the effect, the result, the event, the
pleasure, the trouble, the thrill. That way perhaps lies the
possibility of new error: but that way certainly lies also
the escape from old.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Scottish æsthetic-empirics: Alison.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The trinitarian succession of Scottish æsthetic-empirics—Gerard,
Alison, Jeffrey—could not with propriety
be omitted here, but the same propriety would be
violated if great space were given to them. They
connect with, or at least touch, Burke and Smith
on the one hand, Kames on the other: but they are, if rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>more literary than the first two, very much less so than the
third. All, in degrees modified perhaps chiefly by the natural
tendency to “improve upon” predecessors, are associationists:
and all display (though in somewhat decreasing measure as a
result of the time-spirit) that sometimes amusing but in the
end rather tedious tendency to substitute for actual reasoning
long chains of only plausibly connected propositions, varied by
more or less ingenious substitutions of definition and equivalence,
which is characteristic of the eighteenth century.
Gerard, the earliest, is the least important:<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c010'><sup>[321]</sup></a> and such notice
of Jeffrey as is necessary will come best in connection with
his other critical work. Alison, as the central and most important
of the three, and as representing a prevailing party
for a considerable time, may have some substantive notice
here.</p>

<a id='sec7.5.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Essay on Taste.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Essay on Taste</cite>, which was originally published in 1790,
and which was sped on its way by Jeffrey’s Review (the original
form of the reviewer’s own essay) in 1811, had
reached its sixth edition in 1825, and was still an
authority, though it must by that time have begun to seem not
a little old-fashioned, to readers of Coleridge and Hazlitt. It
is rather unfortunately “dated” by its style, which—even at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>its original date something of a survival—is of the old “elegant”
but distinctly artificial type of Blair: and, as has been
hinted already, it abuses that eighteenth-century weakness for
substituting a “combined and permuted” paraphrase of the
proposition for an argument in favour of the fact. There is
a very fair amount of force in its associationist considerations,
though, as with all the devotees of the Association principle
down to Mill, the turning round of the key is too often taken
as equivalent to the opening of the lock. But its main faults,
in more special connection with our subject, are two. <a id='sec7.5.29'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Its confusions</i></span> The
first is a constant confusion of Beauty or Sublimity
with Interest. Alison exhausts himself in proving
that the associations of youth, affection, &#38;c., &#38;c., cause <em>love</em> of
the object—a truth no doubt too often neglected by the Neo-classic
tribe, but accepted and expressed by men of intelligence,
from the Lucretian <span lang="la"><i>usus concinnat</i></span> down to Maginn’s excellent
“Don’t let any fool tell you that you will get tired of your
wife; you are much more likely to get quite unreasonably
fond of her.” But love and admiration, though closely connected,
are not the same thing, and love and interest are still
farther apart. Another confusion of Alison’s, very germane
indeed to our subject, is that he constantly mixes up the
beauty of a thing with the beauty of the description of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most interesting point, however, about Alison is his
halting between two opinions as to certain Neo-classic idols.
His individual criticisms of literature are constantly vitiated
by faults of the old arbitrariness, especially as to what is
“low.” There is an astonishing lack of critical imagination
in his objections to two Virgilian lines—</p>

<p class='c009'>as “cold,” “prosaic,” “tame,” “vulgar,” and “spiritless.” As

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span></div>
<a id='sec7.5.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and arbitrary absurdities.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These, however, might be due to “the act of God,” to sheer
want of the quality on which the essay is written. A large
part of the second volume exhibits the perils of that
Castle Dangerous, the “half-way house,” unmistakably
and inexcusably. Alison is dealing with the interesting
but ticklish subject of human beauty, and, like Burke, is
justly sarcastic on the “four noses from chin to breast,” “arm and
a half from this to that” style of measurement. But he is himself
still an abject victim of the type-theory. Beauty must suit
the type; and its characteristics must have a fixed qualitative
value—blue eyes being expressive of softness, dark complexions
of melancholy, and so on. But here he is comparatively sober.<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c010'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
Later he indulges in the following: “The form of the Grecian
nose is said to be originally beautiful, ... and in many cases
it is undoubtedly so. Apply, however, this beautiful form to
the countenance of the Warrior, the Bandit, the Martyr, or to
any which is meant to express deep or powerful passion, and
the most vulgar spectator would be sensible of dissatisfaction,
if not of disgust.” Let us at least be thankful that Alison has
freed us from being “the most vulgar spectator.” Why the
Warrior, why the Martyr, why the deep and powerful man,
should not have a Grecian nose I fail to conceive: but the incompatibility
of a Bandit and a straight profile lands me in profounder
abysses of perplexity. The artillery and the blue horse
must yield their pride of place: the reason in that instance is,
if not exquisite, instantly discernible. But nothing in all Neo-classic
arbitrariness from Scaliger to La Harpe seems to me to
excel or equal the Censure of the Bandit with the Grecian
Nose as a monstrous Bandit, a disgustful object, hateful not
merely to the elect but to the very vulgar.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c010'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.5.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>An interim conclusion on the æsthetic matter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Let us hear the conclusion of this whole æsthetic matter.
Any man of rather more than ordinary intelligence—perhaps
any man of ordinary intelligence merely—who has been properly
educated from his youth up (as all men who show even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>a promise of ordinary intelligence should have been) in ancient
and modern philosophy, who knows his Plato, his
Aristotle, and his neo-Platonists, his Scholastics, his
moderns from Bacon and Hobbes and Descartes
downwards, can, if he has the will and the opportunity,
compose a theory of æsthetics. That is to say, he
can, out of the natural appetite towards poetry and literary
delight which exists in all but the lowest and most unhappy
souls, and out of that knowledge of concrete examples thereof
which exists more or less in all, excogitate general principles
and hypotheses, and connect them with immediate and particular
examples, to such an extent as the Upper Powers permit
or the Lower Powers prompt. If he has at the same
time—a happy case of which the most eminent example up
to the present time is Coleridge—a concurrent impulse towards
actual “literary criticism,” towards the actual judgment of the
actual concrete examples themselves, this theory <em>may</em> more
or less help him, need at any rate do him no great harm. <span lang="fr"><i>Mais
celà n’est pas nécessaire</i></span>, as was said of another matter; and
there are cases, many of them in fact, where the attention to
such things has done harm.</p>

<p class='c001'>For after all, once more Beyle, as he not seldom did, reached
the <span lang="la"><i>flammantia mœnia mundi</i></span> when he said, in the character
of his “Tourist” <span lang="la"><i>eidolon</i></span>, “<span lang="fr">En fait de beau chaque homme a sa
demi-aune.</span>” Truth is not what each man troweth: but beauty
is to each man what to him seems beautiful. You may better
the seeming:—the fact is at the bottom of all that is valuable
in the endlessly not-valuable chatter about education generally,
and it excuses, to a certain extent, the regularity of Classicism,
the selfish “culture” of the Goethean ideal, the extravagances
of the ultra-Romantics. But yet</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A God, a God, the severance ruled,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>and you cannot bridge the gulfs that a God has set by any
philosophastering theory.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c010'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Yet although all this is, according to my opinion at least,
absolutely true; although literary criticism has not much
more to do with æsthetics than architecture has to do with
physics and geology—than the art of the wine-taster or the
tea-taster has to do with the study of the papillæ of the tongue
and the theory of the nervous system generally, or with the
botany of the vine and the geology of the vineyard; although,
finally, as we have seen and shall see, the most painful and
earnest attention to the science of the beautiful appears to be
compatible with an almost total indifference to concrete judgment
and enjoyment of the beautiful itself, and even with
egregious misjudgment and failure to enjoy,—yet we cannot
extrude this other <span lang="it"><i>scienza nuova</i></span> altogether, if only because of
the almost inextricable entanglement of its results with those
of criticism proper. And it is more specially to be dealt with
in this particular place because, beyond all question, the direction
of study to these abstract inquiries did contribute to
the freeing of criticism from the shackles in which it had lain
so long. Any new way of attention to any subject is likely
to lead to the detection of errors in the old: and as the errors
of Neo-classicism were peculiarly arbitrary and irrational, the
“high <span lang="de"><i>priori</i></span> way” did certainly give an opportunity of discovering
them from its superior height—the most superfluous
groping among preliminaries and foundations gave a chance of
unearthing the roots of falsehood. As in the old comparison
Saul found a kingdom when he sought for his father’s asses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>so it was at least possible for a man, while he was considering
whether poetry is an <span lang="de"><i>oratio sensitiva perfecta</i></span>, or whether
there is a separate Logic of Phantasy, to have his eyes
suddenly opened to the fact that Milton was not merely a
fanatic and fantastic, with a tendency to the disgusting, and
that Shakespeare was something more than an “abominable”
mountebank.</p>

those of Hume and of Blair, who knew

his own. As for Gibbon, his great

he availed himself little of what it
did give: though on Byzantine literature

1758) which belongs to the University
of Edinburgh, as “wonderfully
profound.” Other annotators, however,
both of this and the <cite>Essay on
Genius</cite> (1774)—for the University authorities
of the past appear to have
been somewhat indifferent to the
fashion in which students used books—do
not agree with him. In plain
truth both pieces are rather trying
examples of that “saying an infinite
deal of nothing” which is so common
in philosophical inquiries. “Facility
in the conception of an object, if it
be moderate, gives us pleasure” (<cite>Taste</cite>,
p. 29); “The rudest rocks and mountains
... acquire beauty when skilfully
imitated in painting;” “Where
refinement is wanting, taste must be
coarse and vulgar” (p. 115). “Perfect
criticism requires therefore” (p. 174)
“the greatest philosophical acuteness
united with the most exquisite perfection
of taste.” “The different works
of men of genius sometimes differ very
much in the degree of their perfection”
(<cite>Genius</cite>, p. 236). “Both in
genius for the arts and in genius for
science Imagination is assisted by
Memory.” Certainly “here be truths,”
but a continued course of reading
things like them begins before long
to inspire a considerable longing for
falsehoods. Gerard, however, though
habitually dull, is less absurd than
Alison, whom he undoubtedly supplied
with his principle of Association.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r325'>325</a>. Had all æstheticians approached
their subject in the spirit of our
English historian of it, much of what
I have said would be quite inapplicable.
“The æsthetic theorist,” says
Mr Bosanquet in his <em>Preface</em> (<em>History
of Æsthetic</em>: London, 1892), “desires
to understand the artist, not in order
to interfere with the latter, but in
order to satisfy an intellectual interest
of his own.” With such an attitude
I have no quarrel: nor, I should
think, need those who take it have
any quarrel with mine. I may add
that from this point onwards I shall
take the liberty of a perpetual silent
reference to Mr Bosanquet’s treatment
of subjects and parts of subjects
which seem to me to lie outside of
my own plan. I purposely abstained
from reading his book until two-thirds
of my own were published,
and more than two-thirds more of
the remainder were written. And I
have been amused and pleased, though
not surprised, to find that if we had
planned the two books together from
the first, we could hardly have covered
the ground more completely and with
less confusion. I cannot, however, help
observing that Mr Bosanquet, like almost
all æstheticians I know, except
Signor Croce, though he does not
neglect literature, at least devotes
most attention to the plastic arts.
This is perhaps a little significant.</p>

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec7.6.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Bearings of the chapter.</i></div>
<p class='c025'>Both in the last volume and in the present Book, repeated
notice has been taken of the importance, as it seems to the
present writer, of the widened and catholicised
study of literature during the earlier eighteenth
century. Not a few of the persons who have had places of
more or less honour in the foregoing chapters—the twin Swiss
schoolmasters, Lessing and the Germans almost without exception,
almost all the English precursors, and some, though
fewer, in other countries—have owed part of their position here
to their share in this literary “Voyage round the World.”
Some further exposition and criticism of the way in which the
exploration itself worked may be looked for in the following
Interchapter. Here we may give a little space to some such
explorers who, though scarcely worthy of a place among critics
proper, did good work in this direction, and to the main lines
and subjects on and in regard to which the explorations were
conducted.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>England.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The most interesting and directly important of the great
literary countries in regard to this matter is undoubtedly
England. Curiosity in Germany was
much more widespread and much more industrious;<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c010'><sup>[326]</sup></a> but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the first place the notable German explorers have already had
their turn, and in the second, the width too often with them
turned to indiscriminateness, and the industry to an intelligent
hodman’s work. France, by providing such pioneers as
Sainte-Palaye, and by starting the great <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Littéraire</cite></span>,
contributed inestimably to the stimulation and equipment of
foreign students; but it was some time before this work reacted
directly on her own literature. We have spoken of Spain,
where for a time the adherents of the older literature were,
like their ancestors in the Asturias, but a handful driven to
bay, instead of as in other countries an insurrectionary multitude
gaining more and more ground; and the traditional Dante-and-Petrarch
worship of Italy did at this time little real good.
Both directly and indirectly—at home and, chiefly in the
Shakespeare direction, abroad—England here deserves the
chief place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her exercises on the subject may be advantageously considered
under certain subject-headings: Shakespeare himself,
Spenser, Chaucer, minor writers between the Renaissance and
the Restoration, Middle English, and Anglo-Saxon. It is not
necessary here to bestow special attention on Milton-study,<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c010'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
despite its immense influence both at home and abroad, because
it was continuous. From Dryden to the present day,
Milton has always been with the guests at any feast of English
literature, sometimes, it is true, as a sort of skeleton, but much
more often as one whom all delight more or less intelligently
to honour.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The study of Shakespeare.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is not mere fancy which has discerned a certain turning-point
of importance to literature, in the fact that between the
Fourth Folio and the first critical or quasi-critical
edition (Rowe’s) there intervened (1685-1709) not
quite a full quarter of a century. The successive editions of
Rowe himself, Pope, Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson
not merely have a certain critical interest in themselves,
not merely illustrate the progress of criticism in a useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>manner, but bring before us, as nothing else could do, the way
in which Shakespeare himself was kept before the minds of
the three generations of the eighteenth century.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c010'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.6.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Of Spenser.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Spenser’s fortunes in this way coincided with Shakespeare’s
to a degree which cannot be quite accidental. The third folio
of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite> appeared in 1679, and the first
critical edition—that of Hughes—in 1715. But
the study-stage—not the theatrical, considering a list of adapters
which runs from Ravenscroft through Shadwell up to
Dryden—had spared Shakespeare the attentions of the Person
of Quality.<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c010'><sup>[329]</sup></a> Before Hughes <a id='err173.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='errata' title='Spenser'>he</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#e_173.11'><ins class='correction' title='Spenser'>he</ins></a></span> had received those of Prior, a
person of quality<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c010'><sup>[330]</sup></a> much greater; but Prior had spoilt the
stanza, and had travestied the diction almost worse than he did
in the case of the <cite>Nut-Browne Maid</cite>. He would not really
count in this story at all if his real services in other respects
did not show that it was a case of “time and the hour,” and if
his remarks in the Preface to <cite>Solomon</cite> did not show, very
remarkably, a genuine admiration of Spenser himself, and a
strong dissatisfaction with the end-stopped couplet. And so of
Hughes’ edition: yet perhaps the import of the saying may
escape careless readers. At first one wonders why a man like
Prior should have taken the trouble even to spoil the Spenserian
stanza; why an editor like Hughes should have taken
the much greater trouble to edit a voluminous poet whose most
ordinary words he had to explain, whose stanza he also thought
“defective,” and whose general composition he denounced as
“monstrous” and so forth; why all the imitators<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c010'><sup>[331]</sup></a> should have
imitated what most of them at any rate seem to have regarded
as chiefly parodiable. Yet one soon perceives that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span><span lang="la"><i>mens agitat molem</i></span>, that the lump was leavened, that, as in
one case at any rate (Shenstone’s), is known to be the fact,
“those who came to scoff remained to pray.” They were
dying of thirst, though they did not know how near the
fountain was; and though they at first mistook that fountain
and even profaned it, the healing virtues conquered them at
last.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Chaucer.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The same coincidence does not fail wholly even with Chaucer,
of whom an edition, little altered from Speght’s, appeared in
1687, while the very ill-inspired but still intentionally
critical attempt of Urry came out in 1721,
Dryden’s wonderful modernisings again coming between. But
Chaucer was to wait for Tyrwhitt, more than fifty years later
(1775) before he met any full scholarly recognition, and this
was natural enough. There had been no real change in
English prosody since Spenser, any more than since Shakespeare:
and the archaism of the former was after all an
archaism not less deliberate, though much better guided by
genius, than that of any of his eighteenth-century imitators.
To the appreciation of Chaucer’s prosody one simple but, till
turned, almost insuperable obstacle existed in the valued
final <em>e</em>, while his language, his subjects, and his thought were
separated from modern readers by the great gulf of the
Renaissance,—a gulf indeed not difficult to bridge after a
fashion, but then unbridged.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.6'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Elizabethan minors.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Invaluable as the study of Shakespeare was in itself, its
value was not limited to this direct gain. Partly to illustrate
him and partly from a natural extension, his fellow-dramatists
were resorted to,—indeed Ben Jonson
and Beaumont and Fletcher had never lost hold of the acting
stage. A few of the greatest, Marlowe especially, were somewhat
long in coming to their own; but with others it was different,
and the publication of Dodsley’s <cite>Old Plays</cite>, at so early a date
as 1744, shows with what force the tide was setting in this
direction. Reference was made in the last volume to the very
remarkable <cite>Muses’ Library</cite> which Oldys began even earlier,
though he did not find encouragement enough to go on with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>it,<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c010'><sup>[332]</sup></a> and the more famous adventure of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Reliques</cite></span> was followed
up in the latter part of the century by divers explorations
of the treasures of the past, notably that of the short-lived
Headley.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c010'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.6.7'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Middle and Old English.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nay, about the close of the seventeenth century and the
beginning of the eighteenth it looked as if early Middle English
and Anglo-Saxon themselves might come in for a
share of attention, as a result of the labours of such
men as Hearne and Hickes. But the Jacobite antiquary was
interested mainly in the historical side of literature, and Hickes,
Wanley, and the rest were a little before their time, though
that time itself was sure to come. And before it came the
all but certain forgeries of Macpherson, the certain forgeries
of Chatterton, the sham ballads with which, after Percy’s example,
Evans and others loaded their productions of the true,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>all worked (bad as some of the latter might be) for good in
the direction of exciting and whetting the literary appetite
for things not according to the Gospel of Neo-Classicism.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.8'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Influence of English abroad.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The study of English literature abroad was somewhat limited
in range, but it had an almost incalculable effect. That
German criticism would have been made anyhow is
certain enough; but in actual fact it would be impossible
to find any actual influences in its making
more powerful than the influence of Milton upon the Zürichers,
and the influence of Shakespeare upon Lessing, and all men
of letters after him. These two great (if not exactly twin)
brethren, from the date of their introduction by that strongest
of ushers Voltaire, exercised, as we have seen, in France an
influence constantly (at any rate in the case of Shakespeare)
increasing, though rejected again and again with horror and
contumely by those who seemed to be pillars. Of older
English writers few except Bacon and Locke had much influence
abroad—and what they exercised was not literary.
But the writers of the eighteenth century were extremely
powerful. Callières very nearly lived to see the time when
France herself, forgetting all about the trinity of <span lang="fr"><i>nations polies</i></span>,
respectfully read, and even sedulously imitated, the people to
whom he had thoughtfully given permission to write in Latin
in order that they might have some literary chance. Nor was
this a mere passing <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span>: nor was it limited to the great
Queen Anne men, Addison, Pope, and Swift, who were themselves
(at least the first two) in many ways germane to French
taste, and had borrowed much from France. Thomson, an innovator
and sower of revolution in his own country, was
warmly welcomed in France: about Richardson the whole
Continent went mad. Sterne excited the strongest interest
both in France and Germany. The odd French taste for the
lugubrious sententiousness of Young was rather later, and so
was the well-known and slightly ludicrous adoration of <i>Ossian</i>.
But throughout the century, until the French Revolution,
English literature was not merely the subject of respectful
study and imitation in Germany but of quite lively interest
in France, of an interest almost startling when it is contrasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>with the supercilious blindness (for a man who cannot use his
eyes may use his eyebrows) of the age of Boileau.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c010'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec7.6.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The study of French at home and abroad.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For the moment—and the fact connects itself sharply and
decisively with the delay of their critical reconstruction—the
French busied themselves less, at least in appearance,
with the exhumation and investigation of their
own literature. Nowhere was more solid work really
done; nowhere were the foundations of mediæval
study, in particular, laid once for all with such admirable
thoroughness. But for a long time the workers cast their
bread upon the waters: and the waters in turn cast it mostly
upon alien shores. The mighty industry of Ducange—in
method and quality as well as time of the seventeenth
century, in effect scarcely to bear full fruit till the nineteenth—had
been entirely included within the seventeenth itself.
That of Sainte-Palaye, which has been alluded to, dates from
the third quarter of the eighteenth. The magnificent <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire
Littéraire de La France</cite></span>, not finished yet, but unresting as unhasting,
was begun as early as 1733; of the Frères Parfait
we have also spoken; Barbazan’s invaluable collection of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Fabliaux</cite></span> appeared in 1756. But, except it may be here and
there on a man of genius like Fontenelle, those publications
had no general literary effect. How little they had may
perhaps best be gauged by the fact that the travestied and
rococo <span lang="fr"><cite>Corps d’Extraits de Romans</cite></span> of the Comte de Tressan,
published long after all of them, <em>had</em> such an effect, and did
rather more harm than good. Still, the two giants of the
French Renaissance, earlier and later, Rabelais and Montaigne,
always kept a hold, and did for France something, though less,
of the good which the great quartette—Chaucer, Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Milton—did for England. Ronsard, as
we have seen, kept, in the worst of times, the respect
and the appreciation of men so different in date and character
as Fénelon and Marmontel: while, if the celebrated
“worship of Lubricity” had something to do with the resuscitation
of others by Prosper Marchand, &#38;c., let this be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>counted for righteousness even to the slippery goddess who
has so little!</p>

<p class='c001'>With the eternal exception of Germany, French literature
during this time was not much studied abroad in its older
divisions, and had not much assistance to offer, in the direction
of which we are now speaking, in its more modern. When a
man like Sterne touched the former, it was probably for the
reasons so handsomely palliated in the last sentence of the
last paragraph: and few others touched it at all. The influence
of the modern literature of France, exaggerated as it may have
been, had yet been considerable enough to deprive it of all
value as an <em>alterative</em> save in the cases of exceptional and
outlying writers like La Fontaine and Fontenelle, and to some
extant Marivaux, the last of whom had himself already derived
much from England, if he was to give much back to her.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c010'><sup>[337]</sup></a> In
other parts of Europe this influence was no doubt still very
great: it conditioned, as we have seen, the powerful action
of Lessing, both in the way of attraction and in that of repulsion.
But of the persons who attracted and inspired Lessing,
Diderot, however unlike Bentham, had something of the
Benthamic fate of requiring transportation and transformation
before he could be really operative; and the gospel of
Marmontel was altogether too inconsistent and transitional
to be very effective. Rousseau, of course, to mention him yet
once more, is epoch-making enough in himself. But Rousseau
is, on the purely literary side, rather an immense propelling
force than an origin: and it is not to be forgotten, though
it often has been, that the <cite>Confessions</cite> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Rêveries</cite></span>, the
most important of his works as literature, did not appear till
after his death. As for <span lang="fr"><cite>La Nouvelle Héloïse</cite></span>, it is a question
whether it is nearly so much a literary origin as <span lang="fr"><cite>Manon
Lescaut</cite></span>, its elder by a generation.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Of Italian.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The effect of Italian literature in Italy was, it has been said,
not at the time great; the contrast between the study of
Shakespeare at this time in England and the study of Dante
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>in Italy has, I have no doubt, defrayed the expense of many
a literary-historical comparison.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c010'><sup>[338]</sup></a> But Italian—though
it had lost something of the prerogative importance
which it had once, and justly, and for a long time
held—retained a great, and, as regards the products of its
best time, a wholly salutary, influence over the rest of Europe.
That rather treacherous turning of French critics on their
Italian masters, which Hurd so acutely noticed, had, like other
things evil, its soul of goodness in it. Ariosto, and Tasso, and
Petrarch, though not Dante, had entered so thoroughly into
the <span lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span> of European literature that they could not be driven
out by any scoffs of Boileau or scorns of Voltaire. And when
people began to examine them for themselves there was, with
the different set of tide and wind which we have seen throughout
this book, a very good chance, almost a certainty, of a healthy
voyage back. There was all the more chance of this that the
strong Renaissance admixture in the authors of the <cite>Orlando</cite>
and the <cite>Gerusalemme</cite>, the at least not strongly mediæval character
of Petrarch, made them more suitable for eighteenth-century
consumption than the pure milk of the mediæval
word. The argument which Hurd himself put about Spenser
and Milton—“<em>These</em> were no barbarians; <em>these</em> were men of
real learning, of polished and statesman-like society; and <em>they</em>
liked romance”—was applicable with even greater force to the
Captain of the Garfagnana and the friend of Leo X., to the
familiar (if also victim) of princes and princesses at Ferrara,
and the Laureate elect of Rome.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Especially Dante.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There can indeed be no doubt that throughout the eighteenth
century it was from these two poets that men drew most of
their ideas of Romance itself. Dryden, on the eve
of that century, betrays the fact in his own case
by his designation of our own Guenevere under her Italian
name of Ginevra. Scott, at its close and far beyond it, wide
as was his knowledge of the true and real mediæval romance
itself, is still haunted by the Italians. While as for Petrarch
(to put out of question the fact that he is of all time, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of the highest of all time), he means the sonnet; and the
sonnet is anti-classical from centre to circumference. Even
if Dante was somewhat neglected, the fact of Gray’s attraction
to Nicholls at their first meeting, because he found that
the young man read that Florentine, is evidence for exception
as well as for rule. At any rate, a man who studied
Italian, whether he were Englishman or Frenchman, German or
from Mesopotamy, might always, and must certainly not
seldom, be brought into contact with the <span lang="it"><cite>Commedia</cite></span>. And
when that contact is established in a fitting soul, “A drear
and dying sound, Affrights the Flamens” of Neo-classicism
“at their service quaint.” You read no more in Boileau that
day, nor any day thereafter by preference and as a disciple.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Of Spanish.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>So also in Spain the home study of the home literature—though
as above noted its results were not by any means
nugatory—was far inferior to the effect of the study
of that literature abroad. The general and half-blind
impulse towards collection and reproduction, however,
was especially important,—hardly even in England, putting the
works of the very greatest out of the question, did anything
appear more precious than the <span lang="la"><cite>Poesias Anteriores</cite></span>: and Spain
had, in three different divisions and directions, inestimable
and inexhaustible treasures for the foreign student, especially
for the foreign student who felt the gall and the cramp of
the classical strait-waistcoat and wished to cast it off. The
first of these in order of time was the ballad matter provided
by the <span lang="es"><cite>Cancioneros</cite></span>. The second was the Spanish drama, and
the reflections which it had drawn from native poets and
critics. The third was the work of Cervantes and the
picaresque novel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first of these were valuable not only as all the ballads
of Europe were valuable, not merely because of the diametrical
opposition of their tone and spirit to that of the “classical”
poetry, but because of their remarkable <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span> as ballads
themselves. In the first place, they<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c010'><sup>[339]</sup></a> are the only <em>Southern</em>
ballads available,—for Italy, though not infertile in folk-song,
does not appear to have had any ballads proper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>those of Modern Greece are of very doubtful earliness, and
were not known till long afterwards. In the second place,
the part-Oriental part-African admixture, which makes <span lang="es"><i>cosas de
España</i></span> so interesting and so powerful, appears in them to
the full. And, lastly, there is a certain <span lang="fr"><i>largeur</i></span> about them—a
national quality, whether excited by conflict with Charlemagne
or by conflict with the Moors, which is lacking in all other
ballads known at least to the present writer. Even the split
between North and South Britain is a case of mere family
misunderstanding, compared with the secular stand of the
great Peninsula, at bay against Christian invaders from the
North and Paynim foes in the household. And it is not
unnoteworthy that, with the exception of <cite>Chevy Chase</cite>, not one
of the very best of ballads in English is inspired by the
quarrel of Englishman and Scot.</p>

<p class='c001'>The influence of the Spanish drama and of the more or
less conscious fight waged in Spain itself over its principles
had also, especially in Germany, great play, and should have
had greater. It reached a climax no doubt in the somewhat
capricious and ill-informed, the certainly intemperate, will-worship
of the Schlegels, which we have not yet discussed:
but as we have seen, Lessing was aware of it, and there is
no doubt that it had great effect on at least the “Sturmers-and-Drangers.”
It ought, we say, probably to have had much
more influence than it actually exercised; but with the decay of
Spanish political power the study of the Spanish language
had been steadily going out in Europe, never, as yet, to revive.
The valuable and interesting Spanish critical discussions on
the subject were almost unknown; and the theatre itself was
never thoroughly studied, till the investigations of Schack, a
German, and Ticknor, an American, in the middle of the nineteenth
century. Yet it is not necessary to spend many words
on showing the immense germinal and alterative power which
this study had, and in particular the value which it possessed
as seconding the influence of the English drama, with just
sufficient difference to make the seconding a real reinforcement,
and not a mere repetition of attack by the same troops. The
obsession of the sealed pattern, the illusion of the undeviating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>rule, might in a Frenchman (for strongest instance) survive
the reading, or at least the hearing, of the “barbarian” Shakespeare:
but it must have been seriously shaken by such writers
of a “polished” nation as Tirso, and Lope, and Calderon, not
to speak of minors like Alarcon and Rojas.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Especially Cervantes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet there can be no doubt that the greatest debt owed
by the eighteenth century, at least, to Spanish goes to the
credit of one great man in the main, and of a
compartment of literature to which that great man,
though transcending it, belonged, in the second—in other
words, to Cervantes and the Spanish novel. The “picaresque”
variety of this novel had early affected both France
and England: and it had virtue enough in it to affect successive
generations, directly or indirectly, from that of Scarron
and Head, through that of Le Sage, down to that of Smollett.
Abundance of things may be said against the picaresque style:
but of one credit nobody can possibly deprive it—that it was
the first kind in Europe to combine the ordinary life of the
<span lang="fr"><i>fabliau</i></span> (and in part the <span lang="fr"><i>novela</i></span>) with the length, the variety,
the quasi-epic conformation and powers of the Romance. And
while all the best of this quality appeared in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> itself,
that mighty book left out almost all the bad and weak concomitants,
and added merit and powers of which the <span lang="es"><cite>Lazarillos
de Tormes</cite></span> and the <span lang="es"><cite>Marcos de Obregon</cite></span> had not a vestige. As we
have seen, Cervantes was something of a Neo-classic himself
in critical principles, and something (though not so much as
has been thought) of an enemy of Romance in purpose. But
his performance was fatal to his teaching in more ways than
one or two: while he certainly gave Fielding the idea of the
modern novel even as a matter of theory and schedule.</p>

<a id='sec7.6.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Of German.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If we say less here of Germany it is not because there is less
to say, but because, in the first place, much of it has been and
much more will be said, elsewhere; and because, in
the second, we should have to give an abstract of
the German literary history of the century. It was not till
very late—till almost the eve of the nineteenth—that German
literature had much effect abroad, or indeed that there was
much German literature to have any effect. But quite early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the Germans began to study their own older writers; and
early and late they, as we have seen, simply flung themselves
on the literature of other countries. It is indeed open to any
one to contend that from the first (some century and a half
ago) to the present day they overdosed themselves with this
as with other studies,—that, taking to it before Germany had
really acquired a continuous and important literary idiosyncrasy
of its own, they have always lacked the <span lang="fr"><cite>pou sto</cite></span>, and
have wasted their labour in consequence. But this is another
and for us an irrelevant question. That they form no exception
to the rule illustrated in this chapter, and that they not
only took the medicine in huge doses themselves, but prepared
it and handed it on to others, as if they wished to be the
literary apothecaries of Europe, this is undeniable.<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c010'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

to be, like the dedication, the work not
of the compiler but of Oldys<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c010'><sup>[334]</sup></a> himself),
criticising its predecessors (including
Gildon) rather severely, and showing
knowledge of English criticism generally;
but the point of chief interest
about the book is its own interest in,
and extensive draughts from, Elizabethan
Drama. Not merely “the
divine and incomparable” Shakespeare,
not merely the still popular sock and
buskin of Ben Jonson and of Beaumont
and Fletcher, but almost all the others,
from Massinger and Middleton down to
Goffe and Gomersall, receive attention,
although, as he tells us, they were so
hard to get that you had to give between
three or four pounds for a volume
containing some ten plays of Massinger.
This is noteworthy; but that his zeal
was not according to full knowledge is
curiously shown by the contempt with
which he speaks, not merely of Bodenham’s
<cite>Belvedere</cite>, but of Allot’s <cite>England’s
Parnassus</cite>, alleging “the little
merit of the obsolete poets from which
they were extracted.” Now it should
be unnecessary to say that Allot drew,
almost as largely as his early date permitted
him, on “the divine and incomparable”
himself, on Spenser, and on
others only inferior to these. But
this carping at forerunners is too
common. If Oldys could write thus,

think not open to any but wilful misunderstanding,
that among the branches
of so-called, and not unjustly so-called,
Criticism which were excluded from
this History was the greater part of
merely commentatorial “scholarship”—the
editing and interpretative part
of the scholarship of the Renaissance
and the succeeding centuries. We
were able, now and then, to admit
critics of the class when, like Politian
in part of his work earlier, or Bentley
later, they came actually within our
range. But classical scholarship has
lain more and more out of our path
as the eighteenth century proceeded,
and it was not till far into the nineteenth,
and then but for a moment,
that the two converged. The greatest
results of this convergence in England
were given by Professors Sellar and
Nettleship, the former in his admirable
series of works on the Roman
Poets, the latter in the essays referred
to above, and by Mr Pater in his dealing
with Plato and other Greeks.
Professor Munro, the greatest light of
the younger University, touched literature
rather less than pure scholarship,
and may perhaps be thought to have
been least infallible when he touched
the former nearest. I had fully perceived
the necessity for this exclusion
before the appearance of Dr Sandys'

is right, from that which is right because it is established,” as
Johnson himself formulates it. And now, of course, the horse-leeches
of definition will ask me to define Romanticism, and
now, also, I shall do nothing of the sort, and borrow from the
unimpeachable authority of M. Brunetière<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c010'><sup>[341]</sup></a> my reason for
not doing it. What most of the personages of this book sought
or helped (sometimes without at all seeking) to establish is
Romanticism, and Romanticism is what they sought or helped
to establish.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>In negative and by contrast, as usual, there is, however, no
difficulty in arriving at a sort of jury-definition, which is perhaps
a good deal better to work to port with than the aspiring
but rather untrustworthy mast-poles of “Renascence of Wonder”
and the like. We have indeed seen, throughout the last volume,
that the curse and the mischief of Neo-classicism lay in the
tyranny of the Definition itself. You had no sooner satisfied
yourself that Poetry was such and such a thing, that it consisted
of such and such narrowly delimited Kinds, that its
stamped instruments and sealed patterns were this and that,
than you proceeded to apply these propositions inquisitorially,
excommunicating or executing delinquents and nonconformists.
The principal uniformity amid the wide diversities of the new
criticism was that, without any direct concert, without any
formulated anti-creed, they all tended to remove the bolts and
the bars, to antiquate the stipulations, to make the great question
of criticism not “What have you proposed to do, and how
have you proposed to do it?” but “What is this that you have
<em>done</em>? and is it good?” But they never, in any instance, formulated
the abolition of restrictions, as, for instance, we shall
find Hugo doing in the Preface to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Orientales</cite></span>. They had
almost invariably some special mediate or immediate object
in view—in Hurd’s case to get rid of the disqualification of
the “Gothic,” in Lessing’s to get rid of the domination of
French. Even Diderot’s Impressionism—the most important
and pregnant phenomenon of the whole—is a matter of practice,
not of theory, of infinite local explorations, not of a
Pisgah-sight. The whole tendency, as we have indicated in
the sub-title of the book, is rather to dissolve what exists than
to put anything definite in its place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The survey of their actual accomplishment,<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c010'><sup>[342]</sup></a> therefore, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>be best executed, for the purpose of corresponding with and
continuing those formerly given, by first considering more
generally the main new critical engines—Æsthetic inquiry
and the Study of Literature—which have formed in detail
the subjects of the last two chapters; then by summarising,
as usual, the most significant performances of national groups
and individuals; and, lastly, by indicating, as best may be done,
the point to which the stage has brought us.</p>

<p class='c001'>The advantages and importance of the wider and more
abstract æsthetic inquiry in reconstituting or reorganising
criticism should be pretty obvious.  The worst fault of the
later Neo-classicism, in its corruption, was that it tended to
become wholly <em>irrational</em>—a mere reference to classification;
that even its appeal to Nature, and to Reason herself, had got
utterly out of <em>rapport</em> with real nature, with true reason.
Now the construction of a general theory of the Sublime and
Beautiful—however partial or however chimerical the inquiry
into the appeals of different arts and different divisions of the
same art—could not but tend—however indirectly, however
much in some cases against the very will of the inquiry—to
unsettle, and sometimes to shatter, the conventional hypotheses
and theories. “Why?” and “Why not?” must force themselves
constantly on such an inquirer; and, as has been said
more than once or twice, “Why?” and “Why not?” are
battering-rams, predestined, automatic, irresistible, to conventional
judgments of all sorts.  It was, indeed, not impossible
for a person sufficiently stupid, or sufficiently ingenious, to
construct an æsthetic which, somehow or other, should fit
in with the accepted ideas.<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c010'><sup>[343]</sup></a>  But what stupid people do does
not count for much in the long-run, despite the proverbial
invincibility of stupidity for the time.  And the ingenious
person, unless his perverseness were truly diabolical, must
sometimes hit upon truth which would explode all his
convention.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time Æsthetics have proved, and might by
an observer of sufficient detachment have from the first
been seen to be likely to prove, a very dangerous auxiliary</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to Criticism, if not even a Stork for a Log.  In the first place,
there was the danger—present in fact from the first, impending
from before the very first—of fresh arbitrary rules being
set up in the place of the old ones,—of the old infinitely mischievous
question, “Does the poet please <em>as he ought to please</em>?”
being juggled into the place of the simple “Does he please?”
No form of abstract inquiry can escape this danger: and that
is why, save in matter of the pure intellect, abstract inquiries
should always be suspected.  Form your theory and conduct
your observations of the æsthetic sense, of “the Beautiful,” of
the mediate axioms of this or that literary kind, as carefully,
as impartially, with as wide a range and view, as you may—these
perilous generalisations and abstractions will always
bring you sooner or later into contact and conflict with the
royal irresponsibility, or (as some may hold it) the anarchic
individualism of the human senses, and tastes, and artistic
powers.  You will hamper your feet with a network of
axioms and definitions; you will burden your back with a
whole Italian-image-man’s rack-full of types.  It is somewhat
improbable that you will be a Lessing: yet even a Lessing
loses himself in inquiries as to what “<em>a</em> jealous woman’s”
revenge will be, what “<em>an</em> ambitious woman’s revenge will
be.”  Shakespeare (for that Shakespeare had very much
to do with the whole portraiture of Margaret, from the first
gracious and playful scene with Suffolk to the sombre and
splendid triumph over Elizabeth Woodville, I at least have
no doubt) has shown us in Margaret of Anjou the revenge
and the other passions of a woman who is at once ambitious,
jealous, the victim perhaps not of actually adulterous but
certainly of rather extra-conjugal love, yet loyal to her husband’s
position if not to himself, a tigress to her enemies and
to her young alike, a rival in varying circumstance, an almost
dispassionate sibyl reflecting and foretelling the woes of her
rivals.  You can no more disentangle all these threads, and
get the passion of this type and the passion of that separate,
than Psyche could have done her task without the ants.  Yet,
early and crude as is the work, it is all right, it is all there.
And Æsthetics are not the ants.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>A much more dangerous result of addiction to the æsthetic
side of criticism, mainly or exclusively, is that you get by
degrees away from the literary matter altogether, and resign
yourself to the separation with all the philosophy of Marryat’s
captain, when he gave orders first that he should be called
when the last ship of his convoy was out of sight behind, and
then when the first hove in sight again.  I remember once
hearing a lecture, and a very interesting one, on Hegel’s idea
of tragedy as illustrated in Shakespeare, delivered by a most
admirable scholar, then professor in one great University, and
now professor in one than which there is no greater.  It
was very ingenious, very stimulating; but I remember thinking
at the close of it that it might have been delivered just as
well if we were in such an infinite state of misery as to
have not a line of an actual tragedy of Shakespeare, but only
abstracts and arguments, as with some of the ancients.  In
the attraction to the æsthetic, the moral, the dramaturgic side
and the like, an absolute break of contact with the literary
may come about.  We have seen that this is the case even with
Lessing, and it is constantly the case with German critics and
with their English followers.  The “word,” the “expression,”
sinks out of the plane of the critic’s purview.  His Æsthetics
become Anæsthetics, and benumb his literary senses and
sensibilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Recurrence to one example of this may suffice.  When I
see Lessing called “the King of Criticism” I always think,
great as is my opinion of him, of that judgment of <cite>Soliman the
Second</cite>.  Here is a thing which, on its own lines and specification,
is, and is practically allowed by the critic to be, a masterpiece.
But he will not accept those lines.  It is a satiric
criticism of life, of the actual nature, morals, <span lang="fr"><i>mœurs, mores, ethe</i></span>,
of men; he wants it to be a didactic exhortation to what those
morals ought (according to him) to be.  He does not find
Soliman’s butterfly veerings from the sentiment of Elvire to
the mere courtesanship of Delia, and from this latter to the
grisettish or soubrettish minxery of Roxelane, attractive or
excusable.  He does not like this minxishness; there are even
signs that he has a private antipathy towards the <span lang="fr"><i>petit nez
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>retroussé</i></span> which plays so great a part in the story.  His criticism
is in consequence not a criticism at all; it is a mere
explosion of unreasoning dislike—at best one of “nervous impression,”
as Flaubert said to Sainte-Beuve.  And if, by a juggle
of words, it be retorted that Lessing is a dogmatic not an
æsthetic critic, this retort will fall blunted from the simple
rectification that he is a dogmatist of æsthetics and an æsthetician
in dogma.</p>

<p class='c001'>The benefits, therefore, of the rise of Æsthetics as a special
study were far from unmixed, though the influence of that
rise was very great.  It is otherwise with the Study of Literature,
to which we have also given a short and summary chapter
above.  Here it was all but impossible that extension of consideration—from
modern and classical to mediæval, from certain
arbitrarily preferred modern languages to others—should fail
to do good.  Prejudice, the bane of Criticism, received, in the
mere and necessary progress of this study, a notice to quit.
This notice took various forms and was exhibited and attended
to in various ways.  England, France, and Germany exhibited
these differences with a difference itself very interesting.  But
they can be reduced to a few heads with very little difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first of these is the attempt to judge the work presented,
not according to abstract rules, derived or supposed to be
derived from ancient critical authority, nor according to its
agreement or disagreement with the famous work of the past.
To some extent this revolutionary proceeding was forced upon
our students by the very nature of the case—it was one of
the inevitable benefits of the extension of study, and especially
of the return to mediæval literature.  To attempt to justify
that literature, as Addison, with more or less seriousness, had
done, by showing that its methods were after all not so very
different from those of Homer, or even Virgil, was in some
cases flatly impossible, in most extremely difficult; while in
almost all it carried with it a distinct suspicion of burlesque.
There was no need of any <span lang="fr"><i>dislike</i></span> of the classics; but it must
have been and it was felt that mediæval and later literature
must be handled <em>differently</em>.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c010'><sup>[344]</sup></a>  And so—insensibly no doubt</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>at first—there came into Criticism the sovereign and epoch-making
recognition of the “leaden rule”—of the fact that
literature comes first and criticism after—that criticism must
adjust itself to literature, and not <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>.  Very likely not
one of the men we are here discussing would have accepted
this doctrine <span lang="la"><i>simpliciter</i></span>:<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c010'><sup>[345]</sup></a> indeed it is the rarest thing to find
it accepted even a century and a half after their time, except
in eccentric and extravagant forms.  But it lay at the root
of all their practice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, that practice, deprived of the crutches and go-carts
of rule and precedent, was perforce obliged to follow the natural
path and play of the feelings and faculties—to ask itself first,
“Do I like this?” then, “How do I like it?” then, “What qualities
are there in it which make me like it?”  Again, these
questions may not have formulated themselves quite clearly
to any of our group.  Again, it would be hard to name many
critics since who have at once fearlessly and faithfully kept
them before their eyes.  But, again also, these were the questions
which, however blindly and stumblingly, they followed
as their guiding stars, and these have been the real questions
of criticism ever since.</p>

<p class='c001'>Postponing the discussion of the relationship of this new
criticism to the old, we may turn to another point of its
<span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span>.  This is that students of mediæval literature
especially were—again perforce and whether they would or
no—driven to make excursions into the region of Literary
History, and, what is more, of Comparative Literary History.
They found themselves face to face with forms—the ballad
and the romance being the chief of them—which were either
not represented at all or represented very scantily and obscurely
in classical literature, while they had been entirely
and almost pointedly neglected by classical criticism.  They
could not but see that, both in mediæval literature proper
and in modern, there were other forms and subvarieties of</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>literature, in drama,<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c010'><sup>[346]</sup></a> in poetry, in prose, which differed extremely
from anything in ancient letters.  In examining these, with
no help from Aristotle, or Longinus, or Horace, they could
not but pursue the natural method of tracing or endeavouring
to trace them to their origins, and in so doing they could
not but become conscious, not merely of the history—so long
interrupted by a mist like that of Mirza’s vision—of English
or French or whatsoever literature itself, but also more dimly
of the greater map of European literature, as it spread and
branched from the breaking up of the Roman Empire onwards.
And this study of Literary History was in the main, this study
of Comparative Literary History was almost absolutely, again
a new thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor were the actual critical results which, either expressly
or incidentally, came from the exercitations of these critics of
less importance.  The turn of the tide may nowhere be seen
so strongly as in Joseph Warton’s audacious question whether
Pope, the god of the idolatry of the earlier part of the century
in England, was a poet, or at least a great poet, at all; in
Lessing’s proposition to call the great Corneille, just re-habilitated
as he had been by Voltaire himself, Corneille
the Monstrous.  These things indeed were, like all revolutionary
manifestos, extravagances, yet the extravagance was not
only symptomatic but to a great extent healthy.  It was
probably impossible as a matter of tactics—it would certainly
have been unnatural as a matter of history and human nature—to
refrain from carrying the war into the enemies’ country,
from laying siege to the enemies’ stronghold.  And this was
invited by the ignorant and insulting depreciation which had
long been, and long continued to be, thrown upon one of the
most charming and precious divisions of the literature and
thought of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there were more sober fruits of the revolt.  Hurd might</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>indeed have developed further that doctrine of Romantic as
independent of Classical Unity, which is one of the most
important discoveries or at least pronouncements of any time,
which practically established a <span lang="la"><i>modus vivendi</i></span> between all
rational Neo-classic and all rational Romantic criticism, and
which has never yet been worked out as it deserves.  Percy’s
<cite>Essay on Alliterative Metre</cite>, despite the comparative narrowness
of its basis, is both acute and successful; and falls in interestingly
with that more intelligent devotion to Prosody which has
up to the present time given better results than any “metacritic,”
and has plenty yet to give.  Thomas Warton, though
often a fanciful and sometimes an insufficiently equipped critic,
was a critic both alert and sound.  Diderot might with advantage
have concentrated that “encyclopædic head” of his
on fewer subjects, have been less anarchic, more subject to
harmless convention.  But there are few better examples in
literature of the “strong young devil shut up in an iron box”
and made to do work—as the Bulgarian peasant defined the
locomotive to an English engineer who went to the Balkans
after the war of 1878.  We have not feared to speak of
Lessing’s shortcomings, but though it is possible to speak indiscreetly
and unadvisedly of his merits in kind and point,
who shall overpraise them in degree?  And the bent of almost
all of them turned, and turned most beneficially, especially in
the case of Warton, to History.</p>

<p class='c001'>The necessary retrospect of the achievement of groups and
countries can be given at no excessive length.  The Germans had
begun criticism later than any other of the great nations; and
they had hardly passed the mere “rhetoric” stage of it when
France was leading Europe in the later Neo-classic phase;
when England was already, under the half-unknowing leadership
of Dryden, sighting the modern conditions; and when
Italy and Spain were passing into a sort of temporary dotage
or trance on the subject.  But during the seventeenth century
the influence of England had been exchanged for that of
France, and this latter, itself originally recommended by Opitz
with a view to the exhibition of Pléiade medicine, had got
this prescription changed, by a sort of legerdemain of Time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the Conjurer, for the very different one of Correctness <span lang="fr"><i>à la</i></span>
Boileau.  Yet the doses of Ronsardism had had great effect
already, and the strong romantic leaven in the Germans, their
pupillary state, their philosophical leanings—above all, that
restless, irresistible, unwearied craving for knowledge which
characterised them—prevented them from abiding in the faith
of Gottsched for any length of time.  We have traced the
gropings and tentatives, the successive stages of Bodmer and
those about him, the arrested promise of J. E. Schlegel, that
Marcellus of German criticism, and we saw how <span lang="fr"><cite>Enfin Lessing
vint</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can, for once, be no harm in attributing part at least
of the deserved prominence of this critic in German criticism to
the fact that he not only exhibited eminently the two great
characteristics of his countrymen in the department,—unwearied
industry in study and philosophic disposition of his
results,—but combined with this exhibition merits which they
much more rarely possess—an intimate though irregular appreciation,
a great intellectual alacrity, and, above all, a really
good and pleasant style.  He did not, unfortunately, help to propagate
these latter qualities so much as he helped to establish
and corroborate the former: but with the limitations noted above,
he did a great deal in almost all ways.  The opinion which
assigns to him, everywhere in literature more or less, but in
criticism most of all, the principal share in that enormous
dead-lift of German letters which marks the middle of the
eighteenth century, and which, <span lang="la"><i>exceptis excipiendis</i></span>, may be said
to have made Goethe and Schiller possible, is unquestionably
right.  And though he did not quite live to see the time when
Germany had begun to repay the enormous debts which, before
his lifetime and during its earlier part, she had accumulated
towards the rest of Europe, he almost saw this: and he had
almost more to do than any other with the counter-accumulation
of the necessary funds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet he himself was, as we have seen, a debtor: and to the
old creditor, France.  The critical history, during this period,
of France herself is the most curious of the three divisions
which here suffice.  In Germany, Neo-classicism, which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>taken no deep root, was easily uprooted.  In England, though
various causes, and especially the immense influence of the
“dead hand” of Addison and Pope, and the living one of
Johnson, kept back the Romantic growth in a salutary fashion,
that growth itself was as steady as it was slow.  In the very
year after Gray died, Coleridge was born: and the lives and
work of these two men mark one unhasting, unresting line of
Romantic progress.  But in France (as the two parallel views
given in the second chapter of the last book, and the fourth
chapter of this, will have shown), although there is no real
confusion, the strands are most puzzlingly twisted during the
whole of this selfsame period, till those of the classical colour
break and ravel away into almost nothing just before the close.
This is due, no doubt, in part to the extreme strength of what
we may call the Neo-classic <em>establishment</em> in France—to the fact
that the strong places of literature are held by classical garrisons,
who take good care to let no unorthodox recruit set
foot in them if it can possibly be helped.  But it is due also
to that essential classicality which has been noticed, and fully
acknowledged, in the French literary temper.  It certainly
exists: and it accounts not merely for the stubborn resistance,
until its sudden <span lang="fr"><i>débâcle</i></span>, of Classicism itself, but also for the
peculiarities of the various greater critics whom we have noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the three greatest of these (for Madame de Staël cannot,
I think, really make out her right to cut in) Joubert excels in
aphoristic and perennial quality, somewhat (not wholly) independent
of time, and Chateaubriand expresses more fully
than any one the tendencies (even in him much chequered by
others) which he was to live to see triumphant without being
quite glad thereat.  But Diderot is, in principle and motive
force, however eccentrically working, if not in actual expressed
example, the most considerable of the three, and perhaps the
most considerable single figure included in this Book.  For
in him, as was said above, we first see as a pervading and
guiding, if not explicitly asserted, principle that Impressionism
which (though the word has been variously used<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c010'><sup>[347]</sup></a>)
is, in its simplest and most natural meaning, perhaps more</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>appropriate to “Modern” criticism than any other single term.
As we have seen and put from many different sides, the
general tendency of ancient and of Neo-classic critics was
always to separate the work as much as possible from the
worker, and (except as regarded oratory and partly drama)
still more from the hearer and reader—this being done for the
freedom of considering it, not so much in and by itself, as in
relation to ideal and <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> schedules of its kind, quality, and
appurtenant rules.  There had been partial and half-conscious
revolts or declensions from this in individuals, from Longinus
to Castelvetro, and from Castelvetro to Fontenelle.  But
Diderot is almost the first person who habitually, naturally, as
a matter of course, isolates the work <em>with himself</em>, considers it
in its form and pressure as printed on <em>him</em>.  And this is almost,
or altogether, a new Covenant of Criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The performance of England here was not so fruitful of great
critical personalities—for her greatest, Johnson, was in intention,
though by no means wholly in performance, on the other
side.  Nor, though the English Æsthetics were influential
abroad as well as at home, can they be ranked very high.  In
the other chief branch, however, of that practical operation
which has been noticed, the rediscovery and revaluation of the
capital of the literature for critical purposes, England takes
the most important position of all—less by the excellence of
the workers (though this was not inconsiderable) than in consequence
of the richness of their material.  The French, except
from the antiquarian side, were still neglecting, and even
for the most part despising, their own old treasures, which were
themselves scarcely so great as those of England: and the
Germans, though not neglectful of what they had, had less,
and dealt with it in a less thoroughly literary spirit.  But
Gray, Percy, Hurd, the Wartons (especially Thomas), and all
the painful and meritorious editors from Theobald to Tyrwhitt,
were engaged, independently in intention, but in fact systematically
enough, not merely in clearing away rubbish and
bringing treasures to light, but in combating the prejudices
and doing away with the delusions and ignorances which had
led to the neglect and contempt of those treasures themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Even those other nations which directly contributed little or
nothing<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c010'><sup>[348]</sup></a> to criticism during the time, contributed, as we have
seen, something also under this head by examination of their
own literatures, and something more by their adoption and
following of English, or of French, or (towards the end) of
German also.  Towards any wide comparative study of literature,
indeed, this period made but a far-off approach: that
could not come till later, though it is the glory of Germany,
in the second division of the time, with which we shall deal
presently, to have begun the attack itself, and made it something
more.  But the study of the individual literature at
different periods has very much the same kind of widening
and altering power as the study of different literatures, and
this at least was vigorously pursued.</p>

<p class='c001'>For after all it is History which is at the root of the critical—as
of almost every other—matter.  To judge you must
know,—must know not merely the so-called best that has
been thought and done and written (for how are you to know
the best till you know the rest?), but to know all, or something
of all, that has been written, and done, and thought by the undulating
and diverse animal called Man.  His undulation and
his diversity will play you tricks still, know you never so
widely; but the margin of error will be narrower, the more
widely you know.  The most perfect critical work that we have—that
of Aristotle and that of Longinus—is due in its goodness
to the thoroughness of the writers’ knowledge of what
was open to them, in its occasional badness and lack of perfection
to the fact that everything was not open to them to
know.  “The goodness of <em>our</em> goodness when we’re good” is
due to our knowing a little more, and the more frequent badness
of our badness when we are bad to our not taking the
trouble to know it thoroughly.</p>

The “Dissolving of Neo-Classicism”
takes in Germany scarcely more than
fifty years at farthest—from 1725 to
1775 or thereabouts; in England about
another quarter of a century, or till
1800 in round numbers; in France a
good century—from 1730 to 1830. In
Italy the solitary figure of Vico anticipates
even the earliest of these dates,
and originates vast alterations in what

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec8.1.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Wordsworth and Coleridge.</i></div>
<p class='c025'>There are many differences, real and imaginary, partial and
general, parallel and cross, between ancient, and mediæval, and
modern poetry; but there is one, very striking, of
a kind which specially differentiates ancient and
mediæval (except Dante) from modern.  In the
former class of poets the “critic whom every poet must
contain” was almost entirely silent, or conveyed his criticism
through his verse only.  It would have been of the very
first interest to have an Essay from the hand of Euripides
justifying his decadent and sentimental fashion of drama, or
from that of Lucretius on the theory and practice of didactic
verse: but the lips of neither were unsealed in this direction.
Dante, on the other hand, as we have seen, was prepared and
ready to put the rationale of his own verse, his own beliefs
about poetry, into prose: so at the Renaissance were the
poets of Italy and France; so was Dryden, so was Pope.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no instance, however, save perhaps that of the Pléiade
and Du Bellay’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense et Illustration</cite></span>, did a protagonist of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the new poetry take the field in prose so early and so aggressively
as did Wordsworth in his Preface to the second edition
of <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>.  In none, without exception, was such an
attack so searchingly criticised and so powerfully seconded,
with corrections of its mistakes, as in the case of the well-known
chapters of the <span lang="la"><i>Biographia Literaria</i></span> in which Coleridge
examined Wordsworth’s examination.  These, it is true, came
later in time, but when the campaign, whereof the first sword
had been drawn in the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>, and the first horn
blown in the Preface of their second edition, though far gone
was not finished, when the final blows, by the hands of Keats
and Shelley, had still to be struck.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The former’s Prefaces.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Preface</cite>, with the little group of other prefaces and
observations which supplements it,<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c010'><sup>[349]</sup></a> provides a bundle of
documents unequalled in interest except by the <span lang="la"><cite>De
Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> in the special class, while, as it
happens, it goes directly against the tenor of that precious
booklet.  Wordsworth, there can be no doubt, had been deeply
annoyed by the neglect or the contemptuous reception of the
<cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>, to which hardly any one had done justice
except the future Archdeacon Wrangham, while his own
poems in simple language had offended even more than <cite>The
Ancient Mariner</cite> had puzzled.  To some extent I do not question
that—his part of the scheme being to make the familiar
poetical, just as it was Coleridge’s to make the unfamiliar
acceptable, the uncommon common—the refusal of “poetic
diction” which he here advances and defends was a <span lang="la"><i>vera causa</i></span>,
a true actuating motive.  But there is also, I think, no doubt
that, as so often happens, resentment, and a dogged determination
to “spite the fools,” made him here represent the
principle as much more deliberately carried out than it actually
was.  And the same doggedness was no doubt at the root of
his repetition of this principle in all his subsequent prose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>observations, though, as has been clear from the first to
almost all impartial observers,<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c010'><sup>[350]</sup></a> he never, from <cite>Tintern
Abbey</cite> onwards, achieves his highest poetry, and very rarely
achieves high poetry at all, without putting that principle
in his pocket.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>That to</i> Lyrical Ballads, 1800.</div>

<p class='c001'>That the actual preface begins with a declaration that he
was rather more than satisfied with the reception of his poems,
and that the appearance of a systematic defence is
set down to “request of friends,” is of course not in
the least surprising, and will only confirm any
student of human nature in the certainty that pique
was really at the bottom of the matter.  As a matter of fact,
there is no more typical example of an aggressive-defensive
<span lang="fr"><i>plaidoyer</i></span> in the whole history of literature.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its history.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It begins with sufficient boldness and originality (indeed
“W. W.” was never deficient in either) with admission that
“by writing in verse, an author is supposed to
make a formal engagement that he will gratify
certain habits of association,” and merely urging that these
habits have varied remarkably.  The principle here is sound
enough; it is in effect the same which we have traced in
previous “romantic” criticism from Shenstone onwards; but
the historical illustrations are unfortunate.  They are “the
age of Catullus, Terence, and Lucretius” contrasted with that
of Statius and Claudian, and “the age of Shakespeare and
Beaumont and Fletcher” with that of Donne and Cowley or
Dryden and Pope.  The <span lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span> of the school towards the
historic argument, and, at the same time, its imperfect
education in literary history, could hardly be better illustrated.
For, not to quibble about the linking of Statius and
Claudian, the age of Catullus and Lucretius was most certainly
<em>not</em> the age of Terence; and the English pairs are still more
luckless.  Donne <em>and</em> Cowley, Shakespeare <em>and</em> Beaumont and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Fletcher, are bad enough in themselves: but the postponement
of Donne to the twin dramatists, when he was the elder of
Fletcher probably by six or seven years, of Beaumont by
ten or twelve, is rather sad. However, it is not on history
that Wordsworth bases his attack.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The argument against poetic diction, and even against metre.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His object, he tells us, was to choose incidents and illustrations
from common life; to relate and describe them, as far
as was possible, in a selection of language really
used by men; and at the same time to throw over
them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby
ordinary things should be presented to the mind in
an unusual aspect—a long but much less forcible
appendix examining why the life so chosen was not merely
“ordinary,” but “rustic and humble.” The kernel of his next
paragraph is the famous statement that all good poetry is “the
spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings,” and then, after a
little divagation, he sets to work to show how such a style
as he was using was adapted to be the channel of such an
overflow. He utterly refuses Personification: he “has taken
as much pains to avoid what is called Poetic Diction as is
ordinarily taken to produce it”; he “has at all times endeavoured
to look steadily at the subject with little falsehood of
description”; and he has not only denied himself false poetic
diction, but many expressions in themselves proper and beautiful,
which have been foolishly repeated by bad poets till they
became disgusting. A selected sonnet from Gray<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c010'><sup>[351]</sup></a> is then rather
captiously attacked for the sake of showing (what certainly
few will admit) that, in its only part of value, the language
differs in no respect from that of prose: whence the heretic
goes farther and, first asserting that there is <em>no</em> essential
difference between the language of Prose and that of Poetry,
proceeds in a note to object to the opposition of Poetry and
Prose at all, and to the regarding of the former as synonymous
with metrical composition. Then he asks what a poet <em>is</em>:
and answers himself at great length, dwelling on the poet’s
philosophical mission, but admitting that it is his business to
give pleasure. He anticipates the objection, “Why, then, do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>you not write in Prose?” with the rather weak retort, “Why
should I not add the charm of metrical language to what I
have to say?” A little later comes the other famous definition
of poetry as “emotion recollected in tranquillity,” with a long
and exceedingly unsuccessful attempt to vindicate some work
of his own from the charge of being ludicrous. And the
Preface ends with two candid but singularly damaging admissions,
that there <em>is</em> a pleasure confessedly produced by metrical
compositions very different from his own, and that, in
order entirely to enjoy the poetry which he is undertaking, it
would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily
enjoyed.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.6'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The appendix: Poetic Diction again.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There is an appendix specially devoted to “Poetic Diction”
in which Wordsworth develops his objection to this. His
argument is curious, and from his own point of
view rather risky. Early poets wrote from passion,
yet naturally, and so used figurative language: later
ones, without feeling passion, imitated them in the
use of Figures, and so a purely artificial diction was formed.
So also metre was early added, and came to be regarded as a
symbol or promise of poetic diction itself. To which of course
it is only necessary to register the almost fatal demurrer,
“Why, if the early poets used figurative language different
from ordinary, may not later ones do so? or do you mean
that Greek shoemakers of Homer’s time said <em>koruthaiolos</em> and
<em>dolichoskion</em>?” Again, “How about this curious early ‘superadding’
of metre? Where is your evidence? and supposing
you could produce any, what have you to say to the further
query, ‘If the metre was superadded, what could have been
the reason, except that some superaddition was felt to be
wanted?’”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Minor Critical Papers.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is proof of the rather prejudiced frame of mind in which
Wordsworth wrote that, in some subsequent criticisms of particulars,
he objects to Cowper’s “church-going bell”
as “a strange abuse”—from which we must suppose
that he himself never talked of a “dining-room,” for
it is certain that the room no more dines than the bell goes
to church. The later papers on “Poetry as a Study,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Poetry as Observation and Description,” are also full of interesting
matter, though here, as before, their literary history
leaves much to desire, and though they are full of examples
of the characteristic stubbornness with which Wordsworth
clings to his theory. The most remarkable example probably
of this stubbornness is the astonishing note to the letter on
the last-named subject (addressed to Sir George Beaumont), in
which, after attributing to the poet Observation, Sensibility,
Reflection, Information, Invention, and Judgment, he adds, with
a glance at his enemy, Metre—“As sensibility to harmony of
numbers <em>and the power of producing it</em> are <em>invariably</em> attendants
on the faculties above specified, nothing has been said
upon those requisites.” Perhaps there is no more colossal
<span lang="la"><i>petitio principii</i></span>, and at the same time no more sublime ignoring
of facts, to be found in all literature, than that “invariably.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.8'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Coleridge’s examination of Wordsworth’s views.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Interesting, however, as the Preface and its satellites are in
themselves, they are far more interesting as the occasion of
the much longer examination of the main document
which forms the centre, and as criticism the most
valuable part, of the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia Literaria</cite></span><a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c010'><sup>[352]</sup></a> of Coleridge,
Wordsworth’s fellow-worker in these same
<cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>. That Wordsworth was himself not wholly
pleased with this criticism of his criticism, we know: and it
would have been strange if he had been—nay, if a much less
arrogant and egotistical spirit than his had taken it quite
kindly. But Coleridge was on this occasion entirely within
his right. The examination, though in some parts unsparing
enough, was conducted throughout in the most courteous, indeed
in the most eulogistic, tone; the critic, especially after
the lapse of so many years,<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c010'><sup>[353]</sup></a> could not be denied the right of
pointing out the limits of his agreement with a manifesto
which, referring as it did to joint work of his and another’s,
might excusably be supposed to represent his conclusions as
well as those of his fellow-worker.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to his competence for the task, there could even then
be little, and can now be no, dispute. Wordsworth himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>though he has left some valuable critical dicta, had by no
means all, or even very many, of the qualifications of a critic.
His intellect, save at his rare moments of highest poetical
inspiration, was rather strong than fine or subtle; and it could
not, even at those moments, be described as in any degree
flexible or wide-ranging. He carried into literature the temperament
of the narrowest theological partisan; and would
rather that a man were not poetically saved at all, than that
he were saved while not following “W. W.’s” own way. His
reading, moreover, was far from wide, and his intense self-centredness
made him indifferent about extending it: while
he judged everything that he did read with reference to
himself and his own poetry.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His critical qualifications.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In all these respects, except poetical intensity, Coleridge
was his exact opposite. But for a certain uncertainty, a sort
of Will-o'-the-Wispishness which displays itself
in some of his individual critical estimates—and for
the too well-known inability to carry out his designs,
which is not perhaps identical, or even closely connected,
with this uncertainty,—he might be called, he may
perhaps even in spite of them be called, one of the very
greatest critics of the world. He had read immensely, and
much of his reading had been in the philosophy of æsthetics,
more in pure literature itself. The play of his intellect—when
opium and natural tendency to digression did not drive it
devious and muddle it—was marvellously subtle, flexible, and
fine. He could take positions not his own with remarkable
alacrity; was nothing if not logical, and few things more than
historical-literary. Further, such egotisms as came into play
in this particular quarrel all made for righteousness in his
case, while they were snares to Wordsworth. It may be ungracious,
but is not unfair, to say that Wordsworth’s contempt
for poetic diction, and his belittling of metre, arose very mainly
from the fact that, in his case, intense meaning was absolutely
required to save his diction from stiffness on the one hand
and triviality on the other, while he had no very special
metrical gifts. Coleridge, though he certainly had no lack
of meaning, and could also write simply enough when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>chose, was a metrist<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c010'><sup>[354]</sup></a> such as we have not more than five or
six even in English poetry, and could colour and harmonise
language in such a way that, at his best, not Shakespeare
himself is his superior, and hardly any one else his equal.
The old, the true, sense of <span lang="la"><i>Cui bono?</i></span> comes in here victoriously.
It was certainly to Wordsworth’s interest that diction and
metre should be relegated to a low place. Coleridge, though
he had personal reasons for taking their part, could do well
without them, and was not obliged to be their champion.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Unusual integrity of his critique.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>However all this may be, there is no doubt about the importance
of the discussion of Wordsworth’s literary theories, in
chaps. xiv. to xxii. of the <cite>Biographia</cite>. Some have
held that Coleridge could not write a book; more
have laid it down that he never did write one.
Certainly the title is to be allowed to the <cite>Biographia</cite> as a
whole only by the most elastic allowance, while large parts
of it are at best episodes, and at worst sheer divagations. But,
if books were not sacred things, it would be possible, and of
no inconsiderable advantage, to sub-title this part of the
book <cite>A Critical Enquiry into the Principles which guided the
Lyrical Ballads, and Mr Wordsworth’s Account of Them</cite>, to
print this alone as substantive text,<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c010'><sup>[355]</sup></a> and to arrange all the
rest as notes and appendices.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Analysis of it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The examination begins with an interesting, and (whether
Epimethean or not) quite probable and very illuminative
account of the actual plan of the <cite>Ballads</cite>, and the
principle on which the shares were allotted. He
and his friend, he tells us, had, during their neighbourly intercourse
in Somerset, often talked of the two cardinal points
of poetry, the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader
by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and the power
of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of
imagination. And he illustrates this finely, by instancing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the sudden charm which accidents of light and shade, of <a id='err208.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='errata' title='moonshine'>moonlight</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#e_208.1'><ins class='correction' title='moonshine'>moonlight</ins></a></span>
or sunset, communicate to familiar objects.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The “suspension of disbelief.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Ballads</cite> were to illustrate both kinds: and the poets
were to divide the parts generally on the principle of Coleridge
endeavouring to make the unfamiliar credible,<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c010'><sup>[356]</sup></a> and
Wordsworth the familiar charming. And with a
charity which, I fear, the <cite>Preface</cite> will not bear, he
proceeds to represent its contentions as applying <cite>only</cite> to the
practical poetical attempt which Wordsworth, in accordance
with the plan, was on this occasion making. He admits however,
that Wordsworth’s expressions are at any rate sometimes
equivocal, and indicates his own standpoint pretty early
and pretty decisively by calling the phrase “language of real
life” <em>unfortunate</em>. And then he proceeds to state his own
view with very frequent glances—and more than glances—at
his companion’s.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Attitude to metre.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>From the first, however, it is obvious that on one of the
two cardinal points—the necessity or non-necessity of metre
in poetry—he is, though hardly to be called in
two minds, for some reason or other reluctant to
speak out his one mind. The revival of this old heresy among
such men as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, is the more to
be wondered at, in that their predecessors of the eighteenth
century had by no means pronounced on the other side in
theory, and that therefore they themselves had no excuse
of reaction. No one who, at however many removes, followed
or professed to follow the authority of Aristotle, could deny
that the subject, not the form, made poetry and poems. But
just as the tyranny of a certain poetic diction led Wordsworth
and others to strike at all poetic diction, so the tyranny of
certain metres seems to have induced them to question the
necessity of metre in general. At any rate Coleridge’s language,
though not his real drift, is hesitating and sometimes almost
self-contradictory. He will on the same page grant that “all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>compositions to which this charm of metre is superadded,
whatever their contents, may be called poems,” and yet lay
down that a poem is “that species of composition which is opposed
to works of science by proposing for its immediate object
pleasure, not truth,” and (after adding to this a limitation,
doubtless intended to take in metre, but nebulous enough to
justify Peacock himself,<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c010'><sup>[357]</sup></a>) will once more clear off his own mist
by saying that if any one “chooses to call every composition
a poem which is rhyme or measure or both, I must leave
his opinion uncontroverted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That he himself saw the muddle is beyond doubt, and the
opposite page contains a curious series of <span lang="la"><i>aporiæ</i></span> which show
the difficulty of applying his own definition.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c010'><sup>[358]</sup></a> The first (<i>i.e.</i>,
fourteenth) chapter ends with a soft shower of words, rhetorically
pleasing rather than logically cogent, about the poet
“bringing the whole soul of man into activity”; “fusing the
faculties, each into each, by the synthetic and magical power
of imagination,” reconciling differences and opposites. “Finally,
good sense is the body of poetic genius, fancy its drapery,
emotion its life, and imagination the soul.” In the fifteenth
and sixteenth the author turns with evident relief from
the definition of the perhaps indefinable to an illustration of
it by discussing <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>. Here, though it would
be pleasant, it would be truancy to follow him.</p>

<p class='c001'>This study, however, is by no means otiose. It leads him
to make a comparison between the poetry of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, and that of “the present age,” a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>comparison of which not the least notable point is a reference
to the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>.<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c010'><sup>[359]</sup></a> <a id='sec8.1.14'></a><span class='sni side7'><cite>Excursus on Shakespeare’s</cite> Poems.</span> Coleridge seems only
to have known it in the Italian translation; but
it is much that he should have known it at all:
and though he does not try to bring out its diametrical opposition
to Wordsworth, that opposition must have been, consciously
or unconsciously, in his mind. And then he comes
back to Wordsworth himself.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Challenges Wordsworth on “real” and “rustic” life.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>He now (chap. xvii.) strikes into a line less complimentary
and more corrective than his earlier remarks. It is true, he
says, that much of modern poetic style is false,
and that some of the pleasure given by it is false
likewise. It is true, further, that W. W. has
done good by his sticklings for simplicity. But
Coleridge cannot follow him in asserting that “the proper
diction for poetry in general consists altogether in language
taken from the mouths of men in real life.” And he proceeds
to show, by arguments so obvious and so convincing that it
is unnecessary to recapitulate them, that a doctrine of this
kind is neither adequate nor accurate—that Wordsworth’s own
poems do not bear it out, and (pushing farther) that poetry
must be “<em>dis</em>realised” (he does not use the word) as much
as possible. He proceeds, cautiously and politely, but very
decidedly, to set the puerilities and anilities<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c010'><sup>[360]</sup></a> of <cite>The Idiot Boy</cite>
and <cite>The Thorn</cite> in a clear light, which must have been extremely
disagreeable to their arrogant author; and goes on to pull
W. W.'s arguments, as well as his examples, to shreds and
thrums. If you eliminate, he says (and most truly), a rustic’s
poverty of thought and his “provincialism and grossness,”
you get nothing different from “the language of any other
man of common-sense,” so that he will not help you in the
least; his speech does not in any degree represent the result
of special and direct communing with nature. Nay, “real”
in the phrase “real life” is itself a wholly treacherous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>equivocal adjective. Nor will you do any good by adding “in
a state of excitement.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>“Prose” diction and metre again.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the next chapter, the eighteenth, Coleridge carries the
fray farther still into the enemy’s country, hitting the blot
that though W. W.'s <em>words</em> may be quite ordinary,
their arrangement is not. And after wheeling
about in this way, he comes at last to the main
attack, which he has so often feinted, on Wordsworth’s astounding
dictum that “there neither is nor can be any essential
difference between the language of prose and metrical composition.”
After clearing his friend (and patient) from an
insinuation of paradox, he becomes a little “metaphysical”—perhaps
because he cannot help it, perhaps to give himself
courage for the subsequent accusation of “sophistry” which
he ventures to bring. Of course, he says, there are phrases
which, beautiful in poetry, are quite inappropriate in prose.
The question is, “Are there no others which, proper in prose,
would be out of place in metrical poetry and <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>?” And
he has no doubt about answering this question in the affirmative,
urging the origin of metre (for which, as we saw, Wordsworth
did not attempt to account), and its effects of use and pleasure.
He will not admit the appeal to nursery rhymes; and he
confesses (a confession which must have given W. W. dire
offence) that he should have liked <cite>Alice Fell</cite> and the others
much better in prose.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, Coleridge still shows too great timidity. He
is obviously and incomprehensibly afraid of acknowledging
pleasure in the metre itself. But—in this differing more
signally from Wordsworth than from Wordsworth’s uncompromising
opponents—he says, “I write in metre, <em>because</em> I
am about to use a language different from that of prose.”
And, though on grounds lower than the highest, he finally
plucks up courage to declare that “Metre is the proper form
of poetry: and poetry [is] imperfect and defective without
metre.” ’Twill serve, especially when he brings up in support,
triarian fashion, “the instinct of seeking unity by harmonious
adjustment,” and “the practice of the best poets of all
countries and of all ages.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span></div>
<a id='sec8.1.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Condemnation in form of Wordsworth’s theory.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is perhaps an anti-climax, though a very Coleridgean
one, when he proceeds to criticise (very justly) Wordsworth’s
criticism of Gray, and some passages both of his
own and others: but we can have no quarrel with
him when he ends the chapter, too verbosely indeed,
but unanswerably, with the following conclusion
of the whole matter: “When a poem, or part of a poem, shall
be adduced, which is evidently vicious in the figures and
contexture of its style, yet for the condemnation of which
no reason can be assigned, except that it differs from the
style in which men actually converse,—then and not till then
can I hold this theory to be either plausible or practicable, or
capable of furnishing either such guidance, or precaution, that
might not, more easily and more safely, as well as more naturally,
have been deduced in the author’s own mind from considerations
of grammar, logic, and the truth and nature of
things, confirmed by the authority of works whose fame is
not of one country and of one age.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="la">Argumentum ad Gulielmum.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>He has now (chaps. xix., xx.) argued himself into more
confidence than he had shown earlier, and seems disposed
to retract his concession that W. W.'s limitations
were <em>not</em> intended to apply to all poetry. He sees,
indeed, from the criticism on Gray, and from Wordsworth’s
references to Milton, that this concession was excessive,
but still he thinks the general notion too monstrous for
Wordsworth to have held. And he swerves, once more, to
point out the especial beauty of beautiful diction and beautiful
metre <em>added</em> to fine or just thought, and introduces interesting
but rather superfluous examples of this from all manner of
poets down to Wordsworth himself. These last lead him to
the very just conclusion, “Were there excluded from Mr
W.'s poetic compositions all that a literal adherence to the
theory of his Preface would exclude, two-thirds at least of the
marked beauties of his poetry must be erased.”<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c010'><sup>[361]</sup></a> Which indeed
is once more a conclusion of the whole matter.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c010'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The study of his poetry.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>After an odd, a distinctly amusing, but despite its title a, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>our purpose, somewhat irrelevant, excursus on “the present
mode of conducting critical journals,”<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c010'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Coleridge
concludes with a pretty long<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c010'><sup>[364]</sup></a> and a very interesting
examination of Wordsworth’s poetry. He brings out his
defects, his extraordinary declension from the felicitous to the
undistinguished, his matter-of-factness of various kinds (this
part includes a merciless though most polite censure of <em>The
Excursion</em>), his undue preference for dramatic [perhaps we
should say dialogic] form, his prolixity, and his introduction
of thoughts and images too great as well as too low for the
subject. The excellences are high purity and appropriateness
of language; weight and sanity of thoughts and sentiments;
strength; originality and <span lang="la"><i>curiosa felicitas</i></span> in single lines and
paragraphs; truth of nature in imagery; meditative pathos;
and, lastly, imagination in the highest and strictest sense of
the word.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>High merits of the examination.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In fact this chapter, which forms in itself an essay of the
major scale, is one of the patterns, in English, of a critical study
of poetry. None, I think, had previously exhibited
the new criticism so thoroughly, and very few, if
any, have surpassed or equalled it since, although
it may be a little injured on the one hand by its limitation
to a particular text, and by the restrictions which the personal
relations of the critic with his author imposed on Coleridge;
on the other, by his own tendencies to digression, verbosity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and intrusion of philosophical “heads of Charles I.” In
fact, there is no other critical document known to me which
attacks the chief and principal things of poetry proper—poetic
language and poetic numbers—in so satisfactory a manner,
despite the economy which Coleridge displays on the latter
head. Some of the ancient and most of the Renaissance discussions
shoot too far and too high, and though the arrows
may catch fire and give a brilliant and striking illumination,
they hit no visible mark. The discussions of Lessing in the
<span lang="de"><cite>Laocoön</cite></span> concern an interesting but after all quite subordinate
point of the relation of poetry to other arts; nearly all of those
in the <span lang="de"><cite>Dramaturgie</cite></span> deal with a part of literature only, and
with one which is not, in absolute necessity or theory, a part
of literature at all. But here we have the very <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span> of
poetry, handled as in the Περὶ Ὕψους or the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span>
itself, but handled in a more full, generally applicable, and
philosophically based manner than Dante’s prose admitted of,
and in a wider range than is allowed by the special purpose
of Longinus.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.21'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Wordsworth a rebel to Longinus and Dante.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With both these great lights of criticism Coleridge agrees
almost as thoroughly as Wordsworth disagrees with them:
and it is proper here to fulfil the promise which
was made<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c010'><sup>[365]</sup></a> of a consideration of Wordsworth’s
work in reference to Dante specially, but with
extension to Longinus as well.</p>

<p class='c001'>The collision of Wordsworth with Longinus appears in the
very title of the famous little treatise. Fight as we may about
the exact meaning of ὕψος, it must be evident, to poets and
pedlars alike, that it never can apply to the “ordinary language
of real life”; struggle as Wordsworthians may, they never can
establish a <span lang="fr"><cite>concordat</cite></span> between the doctrine of the <cite>Preface</cite> and
the doctrine of the “beautiful word.” But as Longinus was
not specifically writing of Poetry, and as in reference to Poetry
he was writing from his own point of view only, on a special
function or aspect of Poetry and Rhetoric alike, he does not
meet the Apostle of the Ordinary full tilt and weapon to
weapon. I have said that I do not know whether, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Wordsworth wrote the <cite>Preface</cite>, he knew the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span> or not.
If Coleridge had known it at the time, he probably would have
imparted his knowledge in the celebrated Nether Stowey talks:
but his own reference, itself not suggestive of a very thorough
appreciation, is twenty years later. And as Wordsworth was
a perfectly fearless person, and had not a vestige of an idea
that any created thing had authority sufficient to overcrow
W. W., he would pretty certainly have rebuked this Florentine,
and withstood him to his face, if he had known his
utterances.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Preface <i>compared more specially with the</i> De Vulgari,</div>

<p class='c001'>But, on the other hand, Dante himself might almost have
been writing with the <cite>Preface</cite> before him (except that had
he done so Wordsworth would probably have
been at least in Purgatory), considering the directness,
the almost rude lie-circumstantial of the
antidote. “Take the ordinary language, especially
of rustic men,” says Wordsworth. “Avoid rustic
[“silvan”] language altogether,” says Dante, “and even of
‘urban’ words let only the noblest remain in your sieve.”
“If you have Invention, Judgment, and half a dozen other
things,” every one of which has been possessed in more or less
perfection by most of the great writers of the world whether
in prose or poetry, “metrical expertness will follow as a
matter of course,” says Wordsworth. “You must, after painfully
selecting the noblest words and arranging them in the
noblest style, further arrange them in the best line that experience
and genius combined can give you, and yet further
build these lines into the artfullest structure that art has
devised,” says Dante. “Poetry is spontaneous utterance,” says
he of Cockermouth. “Poetry, and the language proper for it,
is a regular ‘panther-quest,’ an elaborate and painful toil,”
says the Florentine.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and Dante’s practice</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And their practice is no less opposed than their theory; or
rather the relation of the two, to theory and practice taken
together, is the most astonishing contrast to be
found in Poetry. Dante never falsifies his theory
for a moment. You cannot find a line, in <span lang="it"><cite>Commedia</cite></span> or <span lang="it"><cite>Vita
Nuova</cite></span> or anywhere else, where the “panther-quest” of word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and phrase, and line-formation, and stanza-grouping is not
evident; you will be put to it to find one where this quest
is not consummately successful. And, in following word and
phrase and form, Dante never forgets or starves his meaning.
He may be sometimes obscure, but never because there is no
meaning to discern through the gloom. He may be sometimes
technical; but the technicality is never otherwise than the
separable garb of a “strange and high” thought and intention.
Matter and form with him admit no divorce: their marriage
is not the marriage of two independent entities, but the
marriage of soul and body. He has no need of the alternation
of emotion and tranquillity, of the paroxysm succeeded by
the notebook (or interrupted by it and succeeded by the fair
copy), because his emotion and his tranquillity are identical,
because the tide of his poetry is the tide “too full for sound
or foam,” at least for splash or spoondrift. He is methodical
down to the counting of syllables in poetic words: and yet
who has more poetic madness than he?</p>

<a id='sec8.1.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>with Wordsworth’s.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The difference in Wordsworth is almost startling; it looks
as if it had been “done on purpose.” He does obey his
theory, does accept the language of ordinary life.<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c010'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
But when he does so, as (almost) everybody admits,
he is too often not poetical at all—never in touch with the
highest poetry.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c010'><sup>[367]</sup></a> And (which is extremely remarkable and has
not, I think, been remarked by Coleridge or by many other
critics) even in these poems he has not the full courage of
his opinions. In no single instance does he venture on the
experiment of discarding the merely “superadded charm” of
metre, of which he has such a low opinion. He never in one
single instance relies on the sheer power of “spontaneous
overflow of powerful feelings” on the impetus of “emotion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>recollected in tranquillity,” <em>without</em> metre. In the form of
poetry, which he affects to despise, he is even as these
publicans.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are two sufficiently striking points; but they are not
so striking as the third. Wordsworth <em>is</em> a great poet; he <em>has</em>
moments of all but the sublimest—for this argument we need
certainly not grudge to say of the sublimest—poetry. He can
bathe us in the light of setting suns, and introduce us even
to that which never was on sea and land;<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c010'><sup>[368]</sup></a> he can give us the
full contact, the full ecstasy, the very “kiss of the spouse.”
But in no single instance, again, does he achieve these moments,
except—as Coleridge has pointed out to some extent, and as can
be pointed out without shirking or blenching at one “place”
of poetry—at the price of utterly forgetting his theory, of
flinging it to the tides and the winds, of plunging and exulting
in poetic diction and poetic arrangement.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The comparison fatal to Wordsworth as a critic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>So we can only save Wordsworth the poet—in which
salvage there is fortunately not the slightest difficulty—at
the expense of Wordsworth the critic. Even in
these curious documents of critical suicide there
are excellent critical utterances <span lang="la"><i>obiter</i></span>, and some
even of the propositions in the very argument
itself are separately, if not in their context, justifiable. He
might, if he could have controlled himself, have made a very
valuable exposure, not merely of false poetic diction, but of
that extremely and monotonously <em>mannerised</em> poetic diction
which, though not always bad in its inception and to a certain
extent, becomes so by misusage and overusage. He might
have developed his polemic against the personification of Gray
and others with real advantage. He might have arranged
a conspectus of the sins of eighteenth-century poetic diction,
which would have been a most valuable pendant to Johnson’s
array of the extravagances of the Metaphysicals. He might—if
he had carried out and corrected that theory of his of the
necessity of antecedent “powerful feelings” in the poet—have
produced a “Paradox of the Poet” which would have been as
true as Diderot’s on the Actor, and have had far greater value.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>But he did none of these things; and what he did do is itself
not even a paradox—it is a paralogism.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Other critical places in Coleridge.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>How much better Coleridge comes out of this affair has
already been partly said. But these concluding chapters<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c010'><sup>[369]</sup></a>
of the <cite>Biographia</cite>, though certainly his capital critical
achievement, are very far from being his only
one. Indeed, next to his poetical, his critical work
is Coleridge’s greatest: and with all his everlasting faults of
incompleteness, digression, cumbrousness of style,<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c010'><sup>[370]</sup></a> and what
not, it gives him a position inferior to no critic, ancient or
modern, English or foreign. But it is scattered all over his
books, and it would not be ill done if some one would extract
it from the mass and set it together. In surveying such
examples of it as are here most important, we shall take the
convenient Bohn edition of Coleridge’s Prose, following the
contents of its volumes, but supplementing them to no small extent
with the very interesting and only recently printed notes
which Mr Ernest Coleridge published as <cite>Anima Poetæ</cite>, and
with a glance at the <cite>Letters</cite>.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The rest of the</i> Biographia.</div>

<p class='c001'>Coleridge himself, at the very beginning of the <cite>Biographia</cite>,
has indicated the discussion of the question of Poetic Diction
as the main point which he had in view; but, with
all its gaps and all its lapses, the whole book is
among the few which constitute the very Bible of
Criticism. The opening, with its famous description of the
author’s education in the art under the merciless and yet so
merciful ferule of Boyer or Bowyer; the reference to Bowles—so
little important in himself and on Arnoldian principles, so
infinitely important to “<em>them</em>,” and so to history and to us,
the “us” of every subsequent time; the personal digressions
on himself and on Wordsworth and on Southey—are among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“the topmost towers of Ilion,” the best illustrations of that
“English fashion of criticism” of which, as has been said,
Dryden laid the foundations nearly a century and a half

habit of “Prommy pas Payy”<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c010'><sup>[372]</sup></a> than in reference to
that introduction to the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>—dealing with the

Fancy—to which he coolly refers the reader as if it existed,<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c010'><sup>[373]</sup></a>
just before the actual examination of Wordsworth’s theories in
the <cite>Biographia</cite>, and after the long digressions, Hartleian,
biographical proper, and what not, which fill the second
division of the book. But that one does well to be angry is
not quite so certain. The discussion would probably have
been the reverse of methodical, and it is very far from unlikely
that everything good in it is actually cast up here, or there,
on the “Rich Strand” of his actual work. To return to that
work,<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c010'><sup>[374]</sup></a> there is little criticism in the extraordinary mingle-mangle
of religion, politics, and philosophy, of “Bell and Ball:
Ball and Bell,” Maria Schoening and Dr Price, called
<cite>The Friend</cite>, whichever of its two forms<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c010'><sup>[375]</sup></a> be taken.
At the beginning there are one or two remarks which seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to promise matter of our kind, and there is some good Shakespeare
comment at p. 299: but that is about all.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Aids to Reflection, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Neither should we expect (save on the principle that in
Coleridge the unexpected very generally happens) anything
in the <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite> or the <cite>Confessions of an
Enquiring Spirit</cite>, though in the first there are some
of the usual girds at anonymous reviewing, and the second is
important enough for that equivocal if not bastard variety
of our kind which has “Biblical” or “Higher” tacked before
it. But the three remaining volumes<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c010'><sup>[376]</sup></a> are almost compact
of our matter, while there is not a little of it, and of the
very best quality, in the <span lang="la"><cite>Anima Poetæ</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Lectures on Shakespeare, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The great storehouse next to the <cite>Biographia</cite> is, of course,
the <cite>Lectures on Shakespeare</cite> with their satellite fragments,
unsatisfactory as are the conditions under which
we have all these things. There is perhaps no
more astounding example of the tricks of self-deception
than Coleridge’s statement to Allsop that he had
“<em>written</em>” three volumes of five hundred pages each, containing
a complete critical history of the English drama, and
“requiring neither addition, omission, nor correction—nothing
but mere arrangement.” What we actually have of his whole
critical work, outside the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span>, consists of perhaps one-third
that amount of his own and other people’s notes of
Lectures, very rarely consecutive at all, requiring constant
omission because of repetition, and defying the art of the
most ingenious <em>diaskeuast</em> to get them into anything like
order, and of a smaller but still considerable mass of <span lang="la"><i>Marginalia</i></span>,
pocket-book entries, and fragments of the most nondescript
kinds. And we know from indisputable testimony by persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>who actually heard the <cite>Lectures</cite> which these notes represent,
that if we possessed reports <span lang="la"><i>in extenso</i></span> by the most accurate
and intelligent of reporters, things would be not so very much
better, because of Coleridge’s incurable habit of apology,
digression, anticipation, and repetition. That he found a
written lecture an intolerable trammel, and even notes irksome,
if he stuck close to them, we can readily believe. Many, if
not most, lecturers would agree with him. But it is given to
few people, and certainly was not given to him, to speak <span lang="la"><i>ex-tempore</i></span>
on such subjects in a fashion which will bear printing.
And his lectures have, as we have said, only very rarely had
even the chance of standing this.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their chaotic character</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, we are perhaps not in reality so very much
worse off. Extreme method in criticism is something of a
superstition, and, as we have seen, the greatest
critical book of the world, that of Longinus, has,
as we possess it, very little of this, and does not
appear ever to have had very much. The critic does his best
work, not in elaborating theories which will constantly break
down or lead him wrong when they come into contact with
the myriad-sided elusiveness of Art and Humanity, but in
examining individual works or groups of work, and in letting
his critical steel strike the fire of mediate axioms and <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>
from the flint of these. It does the recipient rather good than
harm to have to take the trouble of selecting, co-ordinating,
and adjusting such things for himself; at any rate, he escapes
entirely the danger of that deadly bondage to a cut-and-dried
scheme which was the curse of the Neo-classic system. And
there is no critic who provides these examinations and <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>
and <span lang="la"><i>axiomata media</i></span> more lavishly than Coleridge.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c010'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span></div>
<a id='sec8.1.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and preciousness.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I remember still, with amusement after many years, the
words of, I suppose, a youthful reviewer who, admitting that
an author whom he was reviewing had applied the
method of Coleridge as to Shakespeare, &#38;c., with
some skill and even some originality, hinted that this method
was quite <span lang="fr"><i>vieux jeu</i></span>, and that modern criticism was taking
and to take an entirely different line. And I have been
grateful to that reviewer ever since for giving me a mental
smile whenever I think of him. That his new critical Evangel—it
was the “scientific” gospel of the late M. Hennequin,
if “amid the memories long outworn Of many-<i>volumed eve and</i>
morn” I do not mistake—has itself gone to the dustbin
meanwhile does not matter, and is not the cause of the smile.
The risibility is in the notion that any great criticism can
ever be obsolete. We may, we must, we ought sometimes
to differ with Aristotle and Longinus, with Quintilian and
Scaliger, with Patrizzi and Castelvetro, with Dryden and Johnson,
with Sainte-Beuve and Arnold. But what is good in them—and
even what, though not so intrinsically good, is injured
only by system and point of view, by time and chance and
fatality—remains a possession for ever. “The eternal substance
of their greatness” is of the same kind (although it be less
generally recognised or relished) as the greatness of creation.
<span lang="fr"><i>La Mort n’y mord</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of such matter Coleridge provides us with abundance everywhere,
and perhaps most on Shakespeare. He acknowledges
his debts to Lessing, and was perhaps unduly anxious to
deny any to the Schlegels; but he has made everything
that he may have borrowed his own, and he has wealth untold
that is not borrowed at all. He can go wrong like
other people. His favourite and constantly repeated denunciation
of Johnson’s couplet—</p>

<a id='sec8.1.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Some noteworthy things in them: general,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But on the very opposite page<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c010'><sup>[379]</sup></a>—in the very corresponding
lines which shut up on this carping when the book is closed—we
read, “To the young I would remark that it is
always unwise to judge of anything by its defects:
the first attempt ought to be to discover its excellences.”
I have found nothing better for the motto
of this Book; I cannot imagine anything better as a corrective
of the faults of Neo-classic critics—as a “Take away that
bauble!” the stop-watch. Again, observe the admirable separation
of poet and dramatist in Lecture vii. of the 1811 course;<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c010'><sup>[380]</sup></a>

articles of a Shakespearian Proverb-book. In the notes referring
(or supposed to refer) to the course of 1818, variations
of the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span> (published the year before) were sure to
occur and do; one of the most noteworthy being the expansion
and application of the idea of “suspension of disbelief.”<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c010'><sup>[384]</sup></a> Note,
too, the acuteness in the censure<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c010'><sup>[385]</sup></a> (with half-apologies) of
the absurd stage-directions which characterised German, and

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span></div>
<a id='sec8.1.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and particular.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the separate notes on Shakespeare’s Plays it is impossible
to say much here: and indeed it is not necessary. They are
to be read—if possible in conjunction with the plays
themselves—by everybody: to digest them into a
formal treatise would be perhaps impossible, and, as hinted
above, would not be a testimonial to their value if it were
possible. But their great merit, next to their individual felicity,
is the constant cropping up of those <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> of a more general,
though not too general, cast which have been noticed.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Coleridge on other dramatists.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Coleridge never admires Shakespeare too much; but the
Devil’s Advocate may perhaps make something of a count
against him that he is often apt to depress others
by a comparison, which is not in the least necessary.
On Ben Jonson he is rather inadequate than
unjust; but he is certainly unjust to Beaumont and Fletcher,
and I almost fear that his injustice, like his more than justice
to Massinger, may be set down to extra-literary causes. It is
extraordinary that such a critic should have used the language
that he uses of Florimel in <em>The Maid of the Mill</em>.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c010'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Her devices
to preserve her honour are extravagant: this extravagance, as
compared with the perfect <em>naturalness</em> of Shakespeare, is the
constant note of “the twins”; and if Coleridge had confined
himself to bringing it out, there would have been no more to
be said. But his remarks are here not merely unjust, they
are silly. And yet here, too, we could find the priceless <span lang="la"><i>obiter
dicta</i></span>, that on words that have made their way despite precisian
objection,<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c010'><sup>[387]</sup></a> those on metre<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c010'><sup>[388]</sup></a> almost always, and others.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Table Talk.</div>

<p class='c001'>The motes fly thick for us in the <cite>Table Talk</cite>; and as they
are clearly headed and indexed in the edition referred to, there
is the less need of additional specification, while
there is, here as everywhere, a good deal of repetition.<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c010'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
But one must point in passing to the striking contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of Schiller’s “material sublime”<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c010'><sup>[390]</sup></a> (and Coleridge was not inclined
to undervalue Schiller<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c010'><sup>[391]</sup></a>) with Shakespeare’s economy of
means; the pertinent, though by no means final, question,
“If you take from Virgil his diction and metre, what do you
leave him?”<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c010'><sup>[392]</sup></a> the remarks on Spenser’s “swan-like movement”;<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c010'><sup>[393]</sup></a>

great <span lang="la"><i>obiter dictum</i></span>,<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c010'><sup>[399]</sup></a> that “Great minds are never in the wrong,
but in consequence <em>of being in the right imperfectly</em>,” which
is truest of all in criticism itself; yet another,<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c010'><sup>[400]</sup></a> “To please me,
a poem must be either music or sense: if it is neither, I confess
I cannot interest myself in it”; and, above all, that on
Tennyson<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c010'><sup>[401]</sup></a>—one of the <span lang="la"><i>loci classici</i></span> of warning to the greatest
critics to distrust themselves when they are judging the poetry
of the “younger generations.” And if we cannot help reproachfully
ejaculating “Æschylus!” when he denies<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c010'><sup>[402]</sup></a> sublimity
to the Greeks, let us again remember that Æschylus
was strangely <em>occulted</em> to the whole Neo-classic age, and that
it is very much Coleridge’s own doing that we of the last
two or three generations have re-discovered him.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Miscellanies.</div>

<p class='c001'>The few contributions, shortly supplemented from MS., to
Southey’s <cite>Omniana</cite> give little, but the volume now entitled
<cite>Miscellanies, Æsthetic and Literary</cite>, is very nearly
all ours. Much of it, however, is repetition in apparent
title, and a good deal of the rest does not quite answer
expectations. The general <cite>Essays on the Fine Arts</cite> with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>it opens (and of which the author, who had lost them, entertained
that perhaps rather exaggerated idea which we usually
entertain of lost loves, books, fishes, &#38;c.) possess in abundance
Coleridge’s uniquely stimulating quality, but, perhaps in not
much less abundance, his extreme desultoriness and want of
definition, save of the most indefinite character. The essay on
the <cite>Prometheus</cite> which follows excites (though hardly in the
wary mind, Estesianly “alphabeted,” as he would himself say)
great expectations. But it is scarcely too much to say that
on this—the most purely poetical of all extant Greek dramas,
a miracle of sublimity and humanity mingled, and the twin
pillar, with the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>, of its author’s claim to be one of
the greatest poets of the world—Coleridge has not a word to
say that even touches the poetry. He is philosophico-mythological
from the egg to the apple; and one is bound to add
that he here shows one of his gravest drawbacks as a critic.
The new fragments, however, of the 1818 lectures are full of
good matter, on Cervantes especially, perhaps a little less
specially on Dante, on Robinson Crusoe very particularly
indeed, on Rabelais and Sterne and Donne: while these are
taken up and multiplied in interest by the “Marginalia,” with
which the literary part of the book concludes, and which contain,
on Daniel and Chapman and Selden, Browne and Fuller,
Fielding and Junius, some of the best known and nearly of
the best of their author’s critical work. Here also, and here
only, do we find much on Milton, Coleridge’s rather numerous
lectures on him having left surprisingly little trace. He is,
though a fervent admirer, not quite at his happiest.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Lecture</i> On Style.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the most interesting piece that the book contains is the
Lecture on Style, with its satellite note (a small but sparkling
star) on the “Wonderfulness of Prose.”<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c010'><sup>[403]</sup></a> The
author’s definition of his most elusive subject is
indeed not only not satisfying, but (unless you remember his
own dictum about being “right incompletely”) demonstrably
and almost astoundingly <em>un</em>satisfactory. “Style is of course
nothing but the art of conveying the meaning appropriately
and with perspicuity.” One feels inclined in one’s haste to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>say, “That is just what it is <em>not</em>”; one must cool down a
little before one can modify this to “Style begins exactly
where” the art, &#38;c., “leaves off,” and one can perhaps never
come nearer to an accommodation than “The necessary preliminary
to Style, and one essential ingredient of it,” is “the art,”
and so forth.<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c010'><sup>[404]</sup></a> It was no doubt this side of the matter that
Coleridge was looking at, and at this he stopped, as far as his
general way of looking at the thing went. But the main interest
of the piece does not lie here. He bases his definition
on, and tries to adjust it to, a survey of English style, which
is probably one of the first of the kind ever attempted, after
the notion of the Queen Anne men being the crown and flower
of English had been given up. And though his history, as
was natural, is sometimes shaky, and his conclusions are often
to be disputed and even overthrown, the whole is of the
highest value, not merely as a <span lang="fr"><i>point de repère</i></span> historically, but
as an introduction to the consideration of Style itself.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.39'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Anima Poetæ.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the book of Coleridge which, next to the <cite>Biographia</cite>,
is of most importance to the student of his criticism, is perhaps
the long-posthumous <span lang="la"><cite>Anima Poetæ</cite></span>. Mr Ernest
Coleridge, in his preface to the <span lang="la"><cite>Anima</cite></span> itself, says
that the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span> is now little read. I hope he is wrong:
but if he is right it would explain many things.</p>

<p class='c001'>This volume—a collection of extracts from Coleridge’s pocket-books—appeared<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c010'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
more than sixty years after the poet’s death,
and the notice taken of it was comparatively small. That it
contains passages of ornate prose superior to anything in the
previously published writings is interesting, but for our purpose
almost irrelevant: it is not so that it gives the fullest
and clearest side-lights on Coleridge’s criticism that we have.
The earliest years (and pages) are not very fertile, though I
subjoin some references<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c010'><sup>[406]</sup></a> which will assist the reader in looking
them up. But from p. 119 for some fifty pages onward
(it is significant that the time of writing, 1805-8, corresponds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>with Coleridge’s absence in Malta, &#38;c., from which we have
little or no published work) the entries are “diamondiferous.”
On French poetry (mistaken but so informingly!);<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c010'><sup>[407]</sup></a> on
Cowper;<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c010'><sup>[408]</sup></a> on the absurdity of calling etymology (how much
more philology!) a “science”;<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c010'><sup>[409]</sup></a> on the attitude to poetry and

passion in the mind for one word to express one
act of feeling” (Flaubert fifty years before date); on pseudo-originality,—Coleridge
is at his very acme. The <em>yeast</em> of criticism—the
reagent which, itself created by the contact of the
critical with the creative, re-creates itself in all fit media—has
never been more remarkably represented than here.</p>

<p class='c001'>And great as are these passages, there are many others
(though not so many in close context) to match them. See
the entry (which I venture to think has been wrongly side-headed
as “A plea for poetic license” at the foot of p. 165)
as to the desire of carrying things to a greater height of
pleasure and admiration than they are susceptible of—the

<p class='c001'>Nor must the <cite>Letters</cite><a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c010'><sup>[418]</sup></a> be omitted in any sufficient survey of
Coleridge’s criticism. That at one early period<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c010'><sup>[419]</sup></a> he apparently
thought Schiller more sublime than Milton is not
in the least to his discredit. He was twenty-two;
he was, I think, demonstrably in love with <em>three</em> ladies<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c010'><sup>[420]</sup></a> at once,
and extremely uncertain which of two of them he should
marry—a state of mind neither impossible nor unnatural, but
likely to lead to considerable practical difficulties, and to upset
the judgment very decidedly. His minor critical remarks at
this very time on Southey’s poems are excellent. That Bowles
should be “divine” and Burke “sad stuff”<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c010'><sup>[421]</sup></a> does not matter—we
can explain both statements well enough. But how many
men of three- or four-and-twenty (or for that matter of three-

It is odd that he should have forgotten (if he knew) Sidney, in

Stella to a woman is “unsexing” it, and his supposition that
“Swift is the authority.”<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c010'><sup>[423]</sup></a> But another astonishing critical
truth is that “Poetry ought not always to have its <em>highest</em>
relish”;<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c010'><sup>[424]</sup></a> and yet another in the contrast<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c010'><sup>[425]</sup></a> of himself with
Southey, “I think too much to be a poet; he too little to be
a great poet,” unjust as the application is in the first half; and
yet again on metre itself “<em>implying</em> a passion,”<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c010'><sup>[426]</sup></a> a passage
worth comparing with, and in some points better than, the
<span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span> (with which compare also pp. 386, 387). Nor these
alone, but many others later—the criticism on Wordsworth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Cintra” pamphlet;<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c010'><sup>[427]</sup></a> that on the inadequacy of one style

cited.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Coleridgean position and quality.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>When the first volume of this history was published, an
excellent scholar said to me, “How will you ever finish that
book?  Why, Coleridge himself would take a
volume!” There is something to be said for the
hyperbole. In this and that critic, of these many
ages which we have essayed to survey, we may find
critical graces which are not in him; but in all, save two, we
shall find corresponding deficiencies. In all the ancient critics,
save these two, the limitation of the point of view, the hamper
of the scheme, are disastrously felt, nor is either Aristotle or
Longinus quite free from them. In the greatest of the sixteenth-century
Italians these limitations recur, and are repeated
in most of those of the seventeenth and eighteenth.
Dante is of the greatest, but he touches the subject very briefly
and from a special side. Dryden is great, but he is not fully
informed, and comes too early for his own point of view.
Fontenelle is very nearly great, but he has the same drawbacks,
and adds to them those of an almost, perhaps a quite, wilful
eccentricity and capriciousness. Lessing is great, but he has
fixed his main attention on the least literary parts of literature;
while Goethe later is great but a great pedant.<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c010'><sup>[430]</sup></a> Hazlitt is
great; but Coleridge was Hazlitt’s master, and beside the
master the pupil is insular and parochial in range and reading
if not in spirit. In Sainte-Beuve himself we want a little more
theory; some more enthusiasm; a higher and more inspiriting
choice of subjects. And in Mr. Arnold the defects of Fontenelle
reappear without Fontenelle’s excuse of chronology.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, then, there abide these three, Aristotle, Longinus, and
Coleridge. The defects of the modern, as contrasted with the
ancient, man of letters are prominent in Coleridge when we
compare him with these his fellows: and so we cannot quite
say that he is the greatest of the three. But his range is necessarily
wider: he takes in, as their date forbade them to take,
all literature in a way which must for centuries to come give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>him the prerogative. It is astonishing how often, when you
have discovered in others of all dates, or (as you may fondly
hope) found out for yourself, some critical truth, you will remember
that after all Coleridge in his wanderings has found
it before, and set it by the wayside for the benefit of those
who come after. For all, I believe, of these later days—certainly
for all whose mother-tongue is English—Coleridge is
the critical author to be turned over by day and by night.
Never take him on trust: it is blasphemy to the Spirit of
Criticism to do that with any critic. Disagree with him as
often as you like, and as you can stand to the guns of your
disagreement. But begin with him, continue with him, come
back to him after excursions, with a certainty of suggestion,
stimulation, correction, edification. <span lang="fr"><i>C’est mon métier à moi
d'être professeur de littérature</i></span>, and I am not going to <em>parvify</em> my
office. But if anybody disestablished us all (with decent pensions,
of course), and applied the proceeds of our Chairs to
furnishing the boxes of every one who goes up to the University
with a copy of the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia Literaria</cite></span>, I should decline
to be the person chosen to be heard against this revolution,
though I should plead for the addition of the <cite>Poetics</cite> and of
Longinus.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.42'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>He introduces once for all the criterion of Imagination, realising and disrealising.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And if any one is still dissatisfied with particular critical
utterances, and even with the middle axioms interspersed
among them, let him remember that Coleridge—not
Addison, not the Germans, not any other—is the
real introducer into the criticism of poetry of the
realising and disrealising Imagination as a criterion.
Even now, a hundred years after his earliest day as
a critic, the doctrine, though much talked of, is apparently
little understood. Even such a critic as the
late Mr Traill, while elsewhere<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c010'><sup>[431]</sup></a> admitting that “on poetic
<em>expression</em>” Coleridge “has spoken the absolutely last word,”
almost apologised<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c010'><sup>[432]</sup></a> for his putting on a level “lending the
charm of imagination to the real” and “lending the force of
reality to the imaginary.” He confessed that, “from the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of view of the highest conception of the poet’s office there can
be no comparison”—where indeed I might also “say ditto to Mr
Burke,” but in a sense opposite to his. And if, on such a mind
and such an appreciation as Mr Traill’s, this one-sided interpretation
of “the <em>esenoplastic</em> faculty” had hold, how much
more on others in increasing measure to the present day? The
fallacy is due, first, to the hydra-like vivacity of the false idea
of <em>mimesis</em>, the notion that it is not re-presentation, re-creation
<em>adding</em> to Nature, but copying her; and, secondly, to the
Baconian conception of poetry as a <span lang="la"><i>vinum dæmonum</i></span>, a poison
with some virtue as a medicine. What power these errors
have all our history has shown,—all Histories of Criticism
that ever can be written will show if they are written faithfully.
But Coleridge has provided—once for all, if it be not
neglected—the safeguard against this in his definitions of the
two, the co-equal, the co-eternal functions of the exercise
of the poetic Imagination.</p>

<div class='c000'></div>
<a id='sec8.1.43'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The “Companions.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the title of the present chapter I have used the word
“companions” in a double sense—the first and special application
of it being that in which it is technically applied
to the Companions of the Prophet—to the
early coadjutors of Mahomet in his struggle with the Koreish.
Of these the chief are Southey, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, and Hazlitt,
with perhaps as an even closer ally—though unknowing and
unknown—William Blake. Then follow companions in the
wider sense—associates in the work, who varied from nearly
complete alliance, as with Scott, to very distant and lukewarm
participation, as in Campbell, and (in literary position) from
the captaincy of Scott again and of Shelley to the more than
respectable full-privateship of the contributors to the <cite>Retrospective
Review</cite>. As for the “Adversaries,” they can be more
briefly dealt with, for their work was mostly “wood, hay,
stubble”; but Gifford and Jeffrey at least could not be excluded
here, and a few more may deserve notice. So let the
inquiry proceed in this order.</p>

<div class='c000'></div>
<a id='sec8.1.44'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Southey.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It may seem at first sight curious, and will perhaps always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>remain a little so, that we have no collected examples, nor
many uncollected but singly substantive pieces, of
strictly critical work, from the most widely read
and the most industrious of the whole literary group of
1800-1830 in England—from a man who, for eleven years
at least, wrote reviews almost wherever he could place them
without hurting his conscience, and who for another five-and-twenty
was a pillar of one of the greatest of critical
periodicals. But Southey’s earlier reviewing is for the most
part not merely whelmed in the dust-bins of old magazines,
but, as his son and biographer complains, extremely difficult
to trace even there; and his later was, by choice or by chance
(more I think by the former than by the latter), mainly devoted
to subjects not purely literary. If that great <span lang="la"><cite>Bibliotheca
Britannica</cite></span><a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c010'><sup>[433]</sup></a> (which so nearly existed, and which is a thing
lacking in English to this present day, a hundred years
later) had come actually into existence, it would hardly have
been necessary to look beyond that: as it is, one has the
pleasing but rather laborious and lengthy duty of fishing out
and piecing together critical expressions from <em>The Doctor</em> and
other books to some extent, and from the two parallel collections
of the <em>Life and Correspondence</em><a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c010'><sup>[434]</sup></a> and the <em>Letters</em><a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c010'><sup>[435]</sup></a> to
a still greater. The process is necessary for a historian of
criticism, and the results, if hardly new to him, are interesting
enough; but they cannot claim any exhibition at all
correspondent to the time taken in arriving at them. Nor
will any such historian, if he be wise, complain, for Southey
is always delightful, except when he is in his most desperately
didactic moods: and the Goddess of Dulness only knows
how even the most egregious of her children, unless from
pure ignorance, has managed to fix on him the title of
“dull.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.45'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>General characteristics of his Criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That “a man’s criticism is the man himself” is almost truer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>than the original bestowal of the phrase; and it is nowhere
truer than with Southey. That astonishing and
almost godlike <em>sanity</em> which distinguished him, in
almost all cases save as regards the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>,
Mr Pitt, the Roman Catholic Church, and my Lord
Byron (who, by the way, lacked it quite as conspicuously in
regard to Southey), is the constant mark of his critical views.
Except his over-valuation of Kirke White,<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c010'><sup>[436]</sup></a> which was undoubtedly
due to his amiable and lifelong habit of helping
lame dogs, I cannot, at the moment or on reflection, think
of any critical estimate of his (for that of himself as a poet
is clearly out of the question) which is flagrantly and utterly
wrong; and I can think of hundreds which are triumphantly
right. In respect of older literature, in particular,<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c010'><sup>[437]</sup></a> his catholicity
is free from the promiscuousness of Leigh Hunt, and his
eclecticism from the caprice of Charles Lamb: while, prejudiced
as he can be, I do not remember an instance in which prejudice
blinds or blunts his critical faculty as it does Hazlitt’s. On
all formal points of English poetry he is very nearly impeccable.
He may have learnt his belief in substitution and
equivalence from Coleridge; but it is remarkable that his
defences of it to Wynn<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c010'><sup>[438]</sup></a> are quite early, quite original, and
quite sound, while Coleridge’s own account long after, in the
preface to <cite>Christabel</cite>, is vague and to some extent incorrect.
He knew, of course, far more literary history than any one
of his contemporaries—an incalculable advantage—and he
could, sometimes at least, formulate general critical maxims
well worth the registering.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span></div>
<a id='sec8.1.46'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Reviews.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of his regular critical work, however, which can be traced
in the <cite>Annual</cite> and <cite>Quarterly Reviews</cite> from the list given by
his son at the end of the <cite>Life</cite>, some notice must
be taken, though the very list itself is a tell-tale
in the large predominance of Travels, Histories, and the like
over pure literature. That he should have made a rule for
himself after he became Laureate not to review poetry (save
in what may be called an eleemosynary manner) is merely
what one would have expected from his unvarying sense of
propriety; but there were large ranges of <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> to which
this did not apply. The articles which will best repay the
looking up are, in the <cite>Annual</cite>, those on <cite>Gebir</cite>, Godwin’s <cite>Chaucer</cite>,
Ritson’s <cite>Romances</cite>, Hayley, Froissart, <cite>Sir Tristram</cite>, Ellis’s
<cite>Specimens</cite>, Todd’s <cite>Spenser</cite>, and <cite>Ossian</cite>; in the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, those
on Chalmers’s <cite>Poets</cite>, Sayers, Hayley again, Camoens, and Lope
de Vega, with some earlier ones on Montgomery (James, not
Robert).<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c010'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.47'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Doctor.</div>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Doctor</cite> also must have its special animadversion, for this
strangely neglected and most delightful book is full of critical
matter. Its showers of mottoes—star-showers from
the central glowing mass of Southey’s enormous and
never “dead” reading—amount almost in themselves to a
critical education for any mind which is fortunate enough to
be exposed to them when young, while the saturation of the
whole book with literature can hardly fail to produce the
same effect. It is lamentable, astonishing, and (the word is
not too strong) rather disgraceful that, except the “Three Bears”
story, the appendix on the Cats, and perhaps the beautiful
early passages on the Doctor’s birthplace and family, the
book should be practically unknown. But it by no means
owes its whole critical value to these borrowed and reset
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>jewels. The passages of original criticism—direct or slightly
“applied”—which it contains are numerous and important.
The early accounts of the elder Daniel’s library<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c010'><sup>[440]</sup></a> and of
Textor’s dialogues<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c010'><sup>[441]</sup></a> are valuable; the passage on “Taste and
Pantagruelism”<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c010'><sup>[442]</sup></a> much more so. On Sermons,<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c010'><sup>[443]</sup></a> on Drayton,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c010'><sup>[444]</sup></a>
on the Principles of Criticism,<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c010'><sup>[445]</sup></a> on the famous verse-tournament
of the Poitiers Flea,<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c010'><sup>[446]</sup></a> on the Reasons for Anonymity,<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c010'><sup>[447]</sup></a> on Mason<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c010'><sup>[448]</sup></a>
(for whom Southey manages to say a good word), on Bowdlerising
and Modernising, and (by an easy transition) Spenser<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c010'><sup>[449]</sup></a>—the
reader will find nuggets, and sometimes whole pockets, of
critical gold, the last-mentioned being one of the richest of
all. It is to Southey’s immortal honour (an honour not sufficiently
paid him by some Blakites) that he recognised and quoted
at length<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c010'><sup>[450]</sup></a> the magnificent “Mad Song,” which is perhaps
Blake’s most sustained and unbroken piece of pure poetry.
His discussion on Styles<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c010'><sup>[451]</sup></a> is of great value: while the long
account<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c010'><sup>[452]</sup></a> of the plays of Langeveldt (Macropedius), and of
our kindred English Morality <cite>Everyman</cite>, shows how admirably
his more than once projected Literary Histories would
have been executed.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.48'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Altogether somewhat</i> <span lang="la">impar sibi</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Still, I am bound to say that he conveys to my mind the
impression of not quite having his soul bound up in the
exercise of his critical function. He was a little too
fond of extending his love of books to those which,
as Lamb would say, are no books—of giving the
children’s bread unto dogs. Occasionally, moreover, that want
of the highest enthusiasm and sympathy, the highest inspiration,
which—after the rather ungracious and ungrateful
suggestion of Coleridge—it has been usual to urge against him,
and which cannot be wholly disproved, does appear. Some
would say that this was due to his enormous reading, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>the penal servitude for life to what was mostly hack-work,
which fate and his own matchless sense of duty imposed upon
him. I do not think so; but of course if it be said that no
one with the more translunary fancies, the nobler gusts, could
have so enslaved himself, an authority<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c010'><sup>[453]</sup></a> who takes so high a
ground must be allowed his splendid say. Anyhow, and on
the whole, we must return to the position that Southey does
not hold a very high position among English critics, and that
it is easier to give plausible reasons for the fact than entirely
to understand it.<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c010'><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.49'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Lamb.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In criticising the criticism of Charles Lamb<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c010'><sup>[455]</sup></a> one has to walk
warily; for is he not one of the most justly beloved of
English writers, and are not lovers apt to love
more well than wisely? I shall only say that
if any be an “Agnist,” I more. Ever since I can remember
reading anything (the circumstance would not have seemed
trivial to himself), I have read and revelled in, and for nearly
forty years I have possessed in fee, a copy of the original
<cite>Elia</cite> of 1823, in the black morocco coat which it put on, at
least seven years before Lamb’s death, in 1827. I have also
read its contents, and all other attainable <cite>Agnalia</cite>, in every
edition in which I have come across them, with introductions
by “Thaunson and Jaunson,” in and on all sorts of shapes and
types and papers and bindings. I have never wearied of reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>them; I am sure I never shall weary as long as eye and
brain last. That Lamb is one of the most exquisite and delightful
of critics, as of writers, is a proposition for which I
will go to the stake; but I am not prepared to confess him as
one of the very greatest in his critical capacity.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.50'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His “occultism”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The reasons for this limitation are to be found in two
passages of his friend Hazlitt—a ruthless friend enough, but
one who seldom goes wrong in speaking of friend
or foe, unless under the plain influence of a
prejudice which here had not the slightest reason for existing.
The passages (referred to again elsewhere) are that on “the
Occult School” in the “Criticism”<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c010'><sup>[456]</sup></a> and one in the “Farewell.”<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c010'><sup>[457]</sup></a>
The first speaks of those “who discern no beauties
but what are concealed from superficial eyes, and overlook all
that are obvious to the vulgar part of mankind.” “If an
author is utterly unreadable they can read him for ever.”
“They will no more share a book than a mistress with a
friend.” “Nothing goes down with them but what is caviare
to the multitude,” &#38;c. The other, in which Lamb is actually
named, contrasts his “surfeit of admiration,” the antiquation
of his favourites after some ten years, with the “continuity of
impression” on which Hazlitt prided himself.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.51'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and alleged inconstancy.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I am inclined to think that both these charges—made with
what is (for the author) perfect good-humour, and only in the
first case slightly exaggerated, as was almost permissible
when he was dealing ostensibly with a
type not a person—are quite true. One would not indeed
have them false; it would be most “miserably wise” economy
to exchange Lamb, as he is, for a wilderness of consistent,
equitable, catholic mediocrities. As Hazlitt himself admits,
<em>this</em> “Occult Criticism” does not or need not come from any
affectation or love of singularity: indeed, some occult critics
“smack of genius and are worth any money.” The Lothario
part of the indictment, the desertion after enjoyment, is perhaps
less easy to authenticate as well as to defend; but I
think it existed, and was indeed a necessary consequence of
the other tendency. If you love merely or mainly as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>collector, and for rarity,—if not only thus but because others
do <em>not</em>,—the multiplication of the object or of the taste must
necessarily have a disgusting effect. “The bloom is <em>off</em> the rye.”
And I should say that, beyond all reasonable question, there
is a distinct character of <em>eccentricity</em> in the strict sense, of whim,
of will-worship, about many, if not most, of Lamb’s preferences.
There is no affectation about him; but there is what might be
affectation in another man, and has been affectation in many
and many another. Take the most famous instances of his
criticism—the defence of Congreve and Wycherley, the exaltation
of Ford, the saying (productive of endless tribulation
to the matter-of-fact) that Heywood is “a prose Shakespeare,”
the enthusiasm shown towards that rather dull-fantastic play
<cite>A Fair Quarrel</cite>, while the magnificence of the same author’s
<cite>Changeling</cite> was left to Leigh Hunt to find out—these and other
things distinctly show the <span lang="it"><i>capriccio</i></span>. Lamb, not Hunt, is really
the “Ariel of Criticism,” and he sometimes pushes tricksiness
to a point which would, we fear, have made his testy Highness
of Milan rather angry. It was probably in conversation rather
than in writing that his fickleness showed itself: we can never
conceive Lamb <em>writing</em> down anything that he had ever written
up.  But something of disillusionment must, as has been said,
almost necessarily have resulted from the peculiarly whimsical
character of his inamoration. Canon Ainger has noted, as the
distinguishing features of Lamb’s critical power, “width and
versatility.” One differs with the Master<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c010'><sup>[458]</sup></a> of the Temple unwillingly
and <span lang="la"><i>suo periculo</i></span>: but neither term seems to me quite
appropriate. “Width” implies continuity, and there is little
of this in Lamb: “versatility” implies a power of turning to
what you will, and Lamb, I think, loved, not as he would but
as he could not help it at the time.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.52'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The early Letters.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But he wants nothing save method and certainty (in response—not
even this in touch), and he has critical graces of his
own which make him all but as great as Coleridge
or Hazlitt, and perhaps more delightful than
either. In his very earliest critical utterances, in the Letters
to Coleridge and Southey especially, much of this delightfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>displays itself as well as its two parents—Lamb’s unconquerable
originality of thought and feeling, and his unsurpassable
quaintness and piquancy of phrase. The critic is, as is inevitable
from his youth, and from the as yet very imperfect
reading which he frankly confesses, a little uncertain and inadequate.
His comparative estimates of Coleridge and Southey,
Southey and Milton, Southey and Cowper, and of all or most
of these poets and others in themselves, exhibit an obviously
unregulated compass—a tendency to correct impression rather
overmuch, because the first striking off of it has been hasty.
But this soon disappears: and though the eccentricity above
noted rather increases than lessens with years, the critic’s real
virtues—those just indicated—appear ever and ever more distinctly
and more delightfully.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.53'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Specimens.</div>

<p class='c001'>In a certain sense they never appear to greater advantage
than in the brief notes included in the <cite>Specimens of Dramatic
Poets</cite> (1808). Everything necessary to excite Lamb’s
critical excellence united here,—actual merit, private
interest (for, though the study of the minor as well as of
the major Elizabethans had been progressing steadily, and
“Dodsley” had gone through several editions, yet the authors
were caviare to the general still); presence of the highest excellence;
and, as we see from the <cite>Letters</cite>, years of familiarity
and fondness on the part of the critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Notes</cite> themselves pretend to no method, and fulfil their
pretence very strictly. Lamb is distinctly inferior to both
his great friends and rivals in <em>grasp</em>. His appreciation is tangential—though
in a different sense from that in which Hazlitt
applies the word to Coleridge. Lamb is not so much desultory
or divagatory as apt to touch his subject only at one
(sometimes one very small) point. The impact results in a
spark of the most ardent heat and glowing light, but neither
heat nor light <em>spreads</em> much. Sometimes, as is inevitable in
this style of criticism, he can be only disappointing: one is
inclined to be pettish with him for seeing nothing to notice in
the vast and shadowy sweep of <cite>Tamburlaine</cite> save an interesting
evidence that Pistol was not merely jesting. Nor is perhaps
Barabbas “a mere monster brought in with a large painted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>nose to please the rabble.” But you must get out of this
mood if you are to enjoy Lamb. How he makes it all up, and
more than up, on <cite>Faustus</cite>, and (when he comes to Dekker)
on <cite>Old Fortunatus</cite>! “Beware! beware!” is the cry here also,
lest we steal too much of his honeydew. Fortunately it has
been so widely used, even for the vulgar purpose of sweetening
school-editions, that it has become generally accessible.
The famous passage on the Witches, which Hazlitt loved to
quote, is perhaps as characteristic as any: the Webster and
Chapman notices are perhaps critically the best.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next in order of time come the articles contributed to the
<cite>Reflector</cite>, especially the magnificent paper on “The Tragedies
of Shakespeare” and their actableness. I may be prejudiced
in favour of this, by caring myself infinitely to read
the drama, and not caring at all to see it acted; but this
objection could not be made to Lamb, who was notoriously a
playgoer, and an eager though unfortunate aspirant to the
honours of the boards. The piece, of course, shows some traces
of the <span lang="it"><i>capriccio</i></span>,—especially in the confession of being utterly
unable to appreciate “To be or not to be,” because of its
being “spouted.” Shakespeare himself might have taught
Lamb better, in a certain passage about age and custom. To
learn, to hear, nay, direst curse of all! to <em>teach</em> “To be or not
to be” leaves it perfect Cleopatra. But Lamb must be Lamb
and keep his Lambish mind: and he keeps it here to great
purpose. The <cite>Lear</cite> passage, the best known and the most
generally admitted as forcible, is not more so than those on
the <cite>Tempest</cite> and on <cite>Macbeth</cite>. They all come to that position
of the true critic (as I believe it to be), which has been
indicated elsewhere, that drama <em>may</em> be literature but is not
bound to be—that they are different things, and that the points
which drama need not have, and perhaps to which it cannot
do full justice, are in literature of the greatest importance.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.54'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Garrick Play Notes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is natural, though they were written so long afterwards,
to take the “Notes on the Garrick Plays” with these other
forerunners and suggesters; nor do I think that so
much of the “first sprightly running” is lost as has
sometimes been thought. How Lamb-like and how pleasant is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the phrase on Day’s quaint <cite>Parliament of Bees</cite>—“the very air
seems replete with humming and buzzing melodies.” (Most
obvious, of course: only that nobody had <em>met</em> it before!) And
the imploration to Novello to set the song from Peele’s <em>Arraignment</em>;
and the fine and forcible plea for the minor Elizabethans
in the note to <em>The Two Angry Women of Abingdon</em> (a play,
by the way, every fresh reading of which makes one more
thoroughly agree with Lamb). The fewness and slightness of
these notes should not be allowed to obscure their quality.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.55'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Miscellaneous Essays.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It was seldom that the bee-like nature of Lamb’s own
genius could settle long on a single flower; and his regular
“studies” are few, and not always of his very best.
The actual state of the paper on <em>The Excursion</em>, after
its mangling by Gifford, illustrates the wisdom of that editorial
counsel, “Always keep a copy,” which the contributor (alas!
we are all guilty) doth so unwisely neglect; and the two best
that we have among the miscellaneous essays are those on
Wither and on Defoe’s secondary novels. It is difficult to
say which is the better: but the singular unlikeness of the
two subjects (except that both Wither and Defoe are eminently
<em>homely</em>) shows what I presume Canon Ainger meant by the
“versatility” of the critic’s genius. Both are admirable, but
most characteristically “promiscuous.” The Defoe piece
avowedly gives stray notes; but the “Wither,” though it has
a beginning, has very little middle, and no end at all.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.56'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Elia.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for <cite>Elia</cite> itself, it is fortunately too well known to need
any analysis or much detailed survey. In the first and more
famous collection the literary element is rather a
saturation than a separable contingent. Except the
“Artificial Comedy” paper, there is none with a definitely
literary title or ostensible subject: while this itself starts in
the closest connection with the preceding paper on Actors,
and is dramatic rather than literary. But the “saturation”
is unmistakable. As one turns the beloved and hundred-times-read
pages, the constant undercurrent of allusion to
books and reading strikes one none the less—perhaps indeed
the more—for familiarity, whether it is at some depth, as in
places, or whether it bubbles up to and over the surface, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Oxford in the Vacation,” and the book-borrowing close of
“The Two Races of Men,” and that other close of that “New
Year’s Eve” which so unnecessarily fluttered Southey’s orthodoxy,
and not a little of “All Fool’s Day”; and in quotations
everywhere.  But in the <cite>Last Essays</cite> Lamb exhibits the master-passion
much more openly.  The “Detached Thoughts on Books
and Reading” of course lays all concealment aside,—it is a
regular <span lang="fr"><i>affiche</i></span>, as are also “The Genteel Style in Writing”
and (most of all) “On Some Sonnets of Sir Philip <a id='corr243.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sidney'>Sidney”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_243.9'><ins class='correction' title='Sidney'>Sidney”</ins></a></span>—the
valiant and triumphant sally against Hazlitt—with not a
little of “Old China” itself.  Everywhere there is evident the
abiding, unfailing love of “the book.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.57'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The later</i> Letters.</div>

<p class='c001'>And if we recur to the <cite>Letters</cite> we shall find the most
abundant proof of this quality.  How admirable are those
criticisms<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c010'><sup>[459]</sup></a> of the second edition of <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>
which, because they are not “neat” praise, roused
the poetic irritability, not merely of Wordsworth, whose
views respecting the reception of his own verse were always
Athanasian, but of Coleridge, who had, at any rate, intervals
of self-perception! How sound the judgment of Mrs Barbauld
and of Chapman (a pleasing pair) to Coleridge himself on Oct.
23, 1802!<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c010'><sup>[460]</sup></a>  How sure the touch of the finger on that absurdity
in Godwin’s <cite>Chaucer</cite> which has been so frequently copied since,
“the fondness for filling out the picture by supposing what
Chaucer did and how he felt”!<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c010'><sup>[461]</sup></a>  The choicest of his observations
are naturally those to Coleridge, almost <i>passim</i>: but the
vein is so irrepressible that he indulges it even in writing to
Wordsworth, though he knew perfectly well that the most
favourable reception could only be a mild wonder that people
could think or talk of any literature, and especially any poetry,
other than “W. W.’s” own.  Even his experiences in 1800
could not prevent him from handling<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c010'><sup>[462]</sup></a> the Poems of 1815 with
the same “irreverent <span lang="la"><i>parrhesia</i></span>” which he uses immediately
after<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c010'><sup>[463]</sup></a> also to Southey on <cite>Roderick</cite> as compared with <cite>Kehama</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and <cite>Madoc</cite>. His famous appreciation of Blake<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c010'><sup>[464]</sup></a> (of whom 'tis
pity that he knew no more) is one of the capital examples of
pre-established harmony between subject and critic. That he
could not, on the other hand, like Shelley, is not unsusceptible
of explanations by no means wholly identical, though partly,
with those which account for Hazlitt’s error. Lamb did not
like the word “unearthly” (he somewhere objects to its use) and
he did not like the thing unearthliness. The regions where, as
Mr Arnold has it, “thin, thin, the pleasant human noises sound,”
were not his haunt. Now Blake always has a homely domestic
everyday side close to his wildest prophetisings,<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c010'><sup>[465]</sup></a> and Shelley
has not. On the other hand, how completely does he grasp
even Cervantes in the few <span lang="la"><i>obiter dicta</i></span> to Southey on Aug. 19,
1825,<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c010'><sup>[466]</sup></a> and how instantly he seizes the “charm one cannot
explain” in <cite>Rose Aylmer</cite>.<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c010'><sup>[467]</sup></a> And his very last letter concerns a
book, and a book on poetry, Phillips’s <span lang="la"><cite>Theatrum Poetarum</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.58'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Uniqueness of Lamb’s critical style</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His love was, as we said, “of the book,” perhaps, rather
than, as in Hazlitt’s case, “of literature.”  The Advocatus
Diaboli may once more suggest that to Lamb the
book was a very little too much on a level with
the tea-pot and the engraving—that he had a shade
in excess of the collector’s feeling about him. But the Court
will not call upon the learned gentleman to say anything more
on that head. It is time to acknowledge, without reservations
or provisos, the unique quality of “Elia’s” critical appreciation.
Very much of this quality—if a quality be separable into parts—arises
from his extraordinary command of phrase,—the phrase
elaborate without affectation, borrowed yet absolutely individual
and idiosyncratic, mannered to the <em>n</em>th, but never mannerised,
in which, though he might not have attained to it
without his great seventeenth-century masters, he stands
original and alone. In no critic perhaps—not even in Mr
Pater—does style count for so much as in Lamb; in none
certainly is it more distinctive, and, while never monotonous,
more homogeneous, uniform, instantly recognisable and self-bewrayed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The simulative power—almost as of the leaf-insect
and suchlike creatures—with which he could imitate styles, is of
course most obvious in the <span lang="fr"><i>tour de force</i></span> of the Burton counterfeits.
But in his best and most characteristic work it is not
this which we see, but something much nobler, though closely
allied to it. It is not Browne, or Fuller, or Burton, or Glanvill,
but something like them, yet different. And though it has
more <span lang="fr"><i>outré</i></span> presentation in some of his miscellaneous writing
than in his criticism, yet it is never absent in the most striking
pieces of this, and gives them much of their hold on us.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.59'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and thought.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Still, those who, however unnecessarily (for no one surely
is going to deny it save in a mood of paradox or of monomania),
insist that style must be the body of
thought—nay, that this body itself must think
(in Donne’s phrase), and not merely live, will find no difficulty
in claiming Lamb as theirs. Nothing of the kind is
more curious than the fact that, strongly marked as are his
peculiarities and much as he may himself have imitated, he
is not imitable; nobody has ever, except in the minutest
shreds—rather actually torn off from his motley than reproducing
it—written in Lamb’s style save Lamb. And accordingly
no one (though not a few have tried) has ever criticised
like Lamb. It is very easy to be capricious, fantastic, fastidious—as
easy as to wear yellow stockings and go cross-gartered,
and as effective. To Lamb’s critical attitude there
go in the first place that love for the book which has been
spoken of; then that faculty of sound, almost common-sense,
“taste” which is shown in the early letters to Coleridge and
Southey; then the reading of years and decades; and, lastly,
the <span lang="fr"><i>je ne sais quoi</i></span> that “fondoos” the other things, as the
old Oxford story has it—a story to be constantly borne in
mind by the critic and the historian of criticism.<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c010'><sup>[468]</sup></a> Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>other ingredients are not too common, especially in conjunction:
the <span lang="fr"><i>je ne sais quoi</i></span> itself is here, and nowhere else.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.60'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Leigh Hunt: his somewhat inferior position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Leigh Hunt<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c010'><sup>[469]</sup></a> claims less space from us than either of his
friends Hazlitt and Lamb. This is not because he is an
inconsiderable critic, for he is by no means this.
As has been said, he has the immense and surprising
credit of having first discovered the greatness
of the tragic part of Middleton’s <cite>Changeling</cite>, as
an individual exploit, and in more general ways he has that,
which Macaulay duly recognised in a well-known passage,<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c010'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
of being perhaps more <cite>catholic</cite> in his tastes as regards English
Literature than any critic up to his time. He has left
a very large range of critical performance, which is very rarely
without taste, acuteness, and felicity of expression; and he has,
as against both the greater critics just named, the very great
advantage of possessing a competent knowledge of at least
one modern literature<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c010'><sup>[471]</sup></a> besides his own, and some glimmerings
of others. He has the further deserts of being almost always
readable, of diffusing a pleasant sunny atmosphere, and of
doing very much to keep up the literary side of that periodical
production which, for good or for evil, was, with the
novel, the great literary feature of the nineteenth century.
These are not small merits: and while they might seem greater
if they were not thrown somewhat into the shade by the
superior eminence of Coleridge and Hazlitt, and the superior
attractiveness of Lamb, they retain, even in the vicinity of
these, claims to full acknowledgment.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.61'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Reasons for it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A severely critical estimate, however, will discover in Leigh
Hunt—perhaps in very close juxtaposition and in a sort of
causal relation to these merits themselves—something
which is not quite so good. Even his catholicity
may be set down in part, by the Enemy, to a certain
loose facility of liking, an absence of fastidiousness and selection.
If Lamb goes too far towards the ends of the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>literary earth for the objects of his affection, Hunt is
rather too content to find them <span lang="la"><i>in triviis et angiportis</i></span>. He does
not exactly “like grossly,” but he likes a little promiscuously.
The fault is no very bad one; and it becomes exceedingly
venial—nay, a positive virtue in time and circumstance—when
we compare it with the unreasonable exclusiveness of the
Neo-classic period. But it is a kind of criticism which inclines
rather too much to the uncritical.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.62'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His attitude to Dante.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A further objection may be taken by applying that most
dangerous of all tests, the question “What does he <em>dis</em>like?”
For the twentieth time (probably) let us repeat
that in criticism likes and dislikes are free; and
that the man who, however unfortunately, still honestly dislikes
what the consensus of good criticism approves, is entitled
to say so, and had much better say so. But he gives his
reasons, descends upon particulars, at his peril. Leigh Hunt,
to do him justice, is not like Mr Rymer—it is not his habit
“no wise to allow.” But it is certainly a pity that one of
his exceptions should be Dante, and it is certainly a much
greater pity that among the reasons given for unfavourable
criticism<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c010'><sup>[472]</sup></a> should be because Dante “puts fabulous people with
real among the damned,” because Purgatory is such a very
disagreeable idea, and because the whole poem contains “absurdities
too obvious nowadays to need remark.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, was merely an exceptional outburst of that
“Liberal” Philistinism and blundering which, it is only fair
to say, had been provoked by plentiful exhibition of the same
qualities on the other side, and which was more particularly
excusable in Leigh Hunt (humanly, if not critically, speaking),
because nobody, not even Hazlitt, had received worse treatment
from that side than himself. But it does something affect his
critical position; for even Hazlitt managed, in some queer
fashion, to distinguish between the prostitute baronet, Sir
Walter Scott, and “the Author of <cite>Waverley</cite>,” between that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>wicked Mr Burke and the author of the great speeches and
treatises. But the main reasons why Hunt must go with
shorter measure than others, is the combination of abundance
in quantity with a certain want of distinction in quality, which
mars his writings. Not even the largest space here possible
would enable us to go through them all, and we should be
able to select but a few that are of unquestionably distinctive
and characteristic <em>race</em>. It is, indeed, rather in his favour
that you may dip almost anywhere into him with the certainty
of a wholesome, pleasant, and refreshing critical bath
or draught. He is very rarely untrustworthy; and when
he is, as in the <i>Dante</i> case, he tells the fact and its secret
more frankly even than Hazlitt himself. But it would be
unjust to refer to no samples of him, and a few of the
most characteristic shall therefore be given.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.63'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Examples from</i> Imagination and Fancy.</div>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately there is an extremely favourable example of
his criticism which fills a whole book to itself, and is written
under something like a general scheme. This is
the volume—modestly sub-titled “Selections,” but
containing a very large proportion of comment and
original matter—which he called <cite>Imagination and
Fancy</cite>,<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c010'><sup>[473]</sup></a> and intended to follow up with four others, though
only one, <cite>Wit and Humour</cite>,<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c010'><sup>[474]</sup></a> was ever written. The plan
was begun late (1844); but as we have seen in almost every
instance, a man’s critical work very rarely declines with years,
unless he actually approaches dotage: and the book is, on the
whole, not merely the most favourable but the most representatively
favourable example of Leigh Hunt’s criticism. It opens
by a set Essay on the question “What is Poetry?” from
which, perhaps, any one who knew the author’s other work,
but not this, might not expect very much, for Hunt had
not an abstract or philosophical head. He acquits himself,
however, remarkably well. His general definition that Poetry
is “the utterance of a passion for truth, beauty, and power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>embodying and illustrating its conceptions by imagination and
fancy, and modulating its language on the principle of variety
in uniformity,” is not bad; but these things are never very
satisfactory. It will be seen that Hunt, like Coleridge, though
with a less “Cimmerian” obscurity of verbiage, “dodges” the
frank mention of “metre” or “verse”; but this is not because
he is in any way inclined to compromise. On the contrary,
he says<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c010'><sup>[475]</sup></a> (taking, and perhaps designedly, the very opposite
line to Wordsworth) that he “knows of no very fine versification
unaccompanied with fine poetry.” But the strength of
the “Essay,” as of the whole book, is in the abundant and
felicitous illustration of the various points of this definition
by commented selections from the poets themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>That catholicity which has been said to be his main critical
virtue will be found (without any of the vice which has been
hinted as sometimes accompanying it) in the very list of
the authors selected from—Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare,
Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Middleton, Dekker, and
Webster, Milton, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats: while the
less “imaginative” poets are by no means neglected, and in
particular Leigh Hunt brings out, often as no one had ever
done before, that sheer poetical quality of Dryden to which
the critics of 1800-1830 had been as a rule unjust. But the
comment (and one cannot say more) is usually worthy of the
selection. The fullest division of all is that on Spenser—indeed
Leigh Hunt’s appreciation of this at once exquisite and
magnificent poet is one of the very best we have, and would
be the best of all if it had been a little more sensitive to
Spenser’s “brave<em>st</em> translunary things,” to the pervading exaltation
and sublimation of thought and feeling which purifies
the most luscious details, and unites the most straggling divagations
in a higher unity. But, short of this, it would be difficult
to have a better detailed eulogium, <span lang="fr"><i>pièces en main</i></span>, of the
subject; nor does Hunt fail to make out something of a
case against, at least, the exaggeration of Lessing’s attack
on the <span lang="la"><i>ut pictura poesis</i></span> view. But his limitations appear in
his complete misunderstanding of Coleridge’s exact and profound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>observation that Spenser’s descriptions are “not in
the true sense of the word <em>picturesque</em>, but composed of a
wondrous series of images as in dreams.” What Coleridge
meant, of course, is that sequence rather than strict “composition”
is Spenser’s secret—that his pageants <em>dissolve into</em>
one another. But in these finesses Hunt is seldom at his
ease. So, again, he blasphemes one of the most beautiful
lines of <cite>The Tempest</cite>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<p class='c009'>as “elaborate nothingness, not to say nonsense” [how nothingness
can in any case be sense he shall tell us], “pompous,”
“declamatory,” and disapproved of by—Pope!</p>

<p class='c001'>One really blushes for him. Could he possibly be unaware
that when a person is about to look at anything, the natural
gesture is to lower the head and thrust it a little forward,
raising or depressing the eyelids at the same time? or be insensible
to the exquisite profile image of Miranda with the long
eyelashes projected against the air? And he was the author
of <cite>A Criticism of Female Beauty</cite>! But if he sometimes misunderstands,
he seldom misses good things such as (it is true
Warton put him on this) the Medea passage of Gower.<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c010'><sup>[476]</sup></a> Ben
Jonson made him uncomfortable, which is again a pity; and
on Beaumont and Fletcher he is at almost his very worst:
but he is sounder than some greater ones on Ford and
Massinger, and his great “catch” of De Flores deserves yet a
third mention. He is at his very best and pleasantest, too,
where most men fail—where they are even often very <em>un</em>pleasant—on
his contemporaries, Coleridge, and Shelley, and
Keats. When you have said such a thing as this<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c010'><sup>[477]</sup></a> of Coleridge,
“Of pure poetry, ... consisting of nothing but its
essential self, ... he was the greatest master of his time,”
you had better “stand down.” Your critical claim is made
out: you may damage but can hardly increase it. Yet it
is only in the severe court of critical history that one would
wish to silence Hunt: for, in truth, nine-tenths of his criticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>is admirable, and most admirably suited to instruct and encourage
the average man. Impressionism and Rulelessness are
almost as fairly justified of him, their child, as of any other
that I can think of. They scarcely ever lead him wrong in
liking; and he mentions what he dislikes so seldom that he
has only occasional chances of being wrong there.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.64'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hazlitt.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But the greatest of the “Cockney critics” (<span lang="fr"><i>quelle Cocaigne!</i></span>)
has yet to come. There is “a company of warm young men,”
as Dryden has it, who would doubtless disdain the
inquiry whether Coleridge or Hazlitt is the greatest
of English critics; and it is quite certain that this inquiry
might be conducted in a sufficiently futile sense and manner.
There are others, less disdainful, who might perhaps be staggered
by the acknowledgment <span lang="la"><i>in limine</i></span> that it is possible to answer
the question either way—nay, for the same person to give
both answers, and yet be “not unwelcome back again” as a
reasonable disputant. I have myself in my time, I think,
committed myself to both propositions; and I am not at all
disposed to give up either—for reasons which it will be more
proper to give at the end than at the beginning of an examination
of Hazlitt himself. That he was a great critic there will
probably now be little dispute, though Goethe is said not to
have found much good in him; though persons of worship,
including Mr Stevenson, have thought him greater as a miscellaneous
essayist; and though you may read writings of
considerable length upon him in which no attempt is made
to bring out his critical character at all.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.65'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Method of dealing with him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His critical deliverances are so numerous and so voluminous
that the “brick of the house” process, which we have
frequently found applicable, has in his case to be
given up, or at least considerably modified—for it
is too much the principle of the present History
to be given up altogether. Fortunately there is no difficulty
in the modification. Hazlitt is not, like Coleridge, remarkable
for the discovery and enunciation of any one great critical
principle, or for the emission (<span lang="la"><i>obiter</i></span> or otherwise) of remarkable
mediate <span lang="la"><i>dicta</i></span>, or for <span lang="la"><i>marginalia</i></span> on individual passages or
lines, though sometimes he can do the last and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>also the second of these things. What he is remarkable for
is his extraordinary fertility and felicity, as regards English
literature, in judgments, more or less “grasped,” of individual
authors, books, or pieces. As, by preference, he stops at
the passage, and does not descend to the individual line or
phrase, so, by preference also,<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c010'><sup>[478]</sup></a> he stops at the individual
example of the Kind, and does not ascend to the Kind itself,
or at least is not usually very happy in his ascension. But
within these limits (and they are wide enough), the fertility
and the felicity of his criticism are things which strike one
almost dumb with admiration; and this in spite of certain
obvious and in their way extremely grave faults.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most obvious, though by far the least, of these,—indeed
one which is displayed with such frankness and in a way
so little delusive as to be hardly a fault at all, though it is
certainly a drawback,—is a sort of audacious sciolism—acquiescence
in ignorance, indifference about “satisfying the
examiners”—for half a dozen different names would be required
to bring out all the sides of it.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.66'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His surface and occasional faults: Imperfect knowledge and method.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His almost entire ignorance of all literatures but his own
gives him no trouble, though it cannot be said that it does
him no harm. In treating of comic writers, not
in English only but generally, he says<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c010'><sup>[479]</sup></a> (with perfect
truth) that Aristophanes and Lucian are two of the
four chief names for comic humour, but that he
shall say little of them, for he knows little. Would
all men were as honest! but one cannot say, “Would all critics
were as ignorant!” In his <cite>Lectures on the English Poets</cite> he is
transparently, and again quite honestly, ignorant of mostly
all the earlier minorities, with some not so minor. He almost
prided himself upon not reading anything in the writing
period of his life; and he seems to have carried out his
principles so conscientiously that, if anything occurred in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the course of a lecture which was unknown to him, he never
made the slightest effort to supply the gap. His insouciance
in method was equal to that in regard to material; and when
we find<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c010'><sup>[480]</sup></a> Godwin and Mrs Radcliffe included, with no satiric
purpose, among “The English Comic Writers,” they are
introduced so naturally that the absurdity hardly strikes us
till some accident wakes us up to it. If inaccuracies in matters
of fact are not very common in him, it is because, like a
true critic, he pays very little attention to such matters, and
is wholly in opinion and appreciation and judgment, and other
things where the free spirit is kept straight, if at all, by its
own instinct. But he does commit such inaccuracies, and
would evidently commit many more if he ran the risk of
them oftener.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.67'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Extra-literary prejudice.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The last and gravest of his drawbacks has to be mentioned,
and though it may be slurred over by political partisanship,
those who admire and exalt him in spite of and not
because of his politics, are well entitled to call
attention to it. To the unpleasantness of Hazlitt’s
personal temper we have the unchallengeable testimony of his
friends Lamb, who was the most charitable, and Hunt, who
with all his faults was one of the most good-natured, of mortals.
But what we may call his political temper, especially when it
was further exasperated by his personal, is something of the
equal of which no time leaves record. Whenever this east
wind blows, the true but reasonable Hazlittian had better,
speaking figuratively, “go to bed till it is over,” as John Hall
Stevenson is said to have done literally in the case of the
literal Eurus. Not only does Hazlitt then cease to be a critic,—he
ceases to be a rational being. Sidney and Scott are the
main instances of its effect, because Sidney could not have
annoyed, and Scott we know did not in any way annoy, Hazlitt
personally. Gifford is not in this case, and he was himself
so fond of playing at the roughest of bowls that nobody need
pity him for the rubbers he met. But Hazlitt’s famous <cite>Letter</cite>
to him, which some admire, always, I confess, makes me think
of the Doll’s-dressmaker’s father’s last fit of the horrors in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span><cite>Our Mutual Friend</cite>, and of the way in which the luckless
“man talent” fought with the police and “laid about him
hopelessly, fiercely, staringly, convulsively, foamingly.” Fortunately
the effect was not so fatal, and I know no other
instance in which Hazlitt actually required the strait waistcoat.<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c010'><sup>[481]</sup></a>
But he certainly did here: and in a considerable
number of instances his prejudices have made him, if not
exactly <span lang="la"><i>non compos mentis</i></span>, yet certainly <span lang="la"><i>non compos judicii</i></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.68'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His radical and usual excellence.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately, however, the wind does not always blow from
this quarter with him, and when it does the symptoms are so
unmistakable that nobody can be deceived unless
he chooses to be, or is so stupid that it really does
not matter whether he is deceived or not. Far
more usually it is set in a bracing North or fertilising West,
not seldom even in the “summer South” itself. And then you
get such appreciations, in the best, the most thorough, the most
delightful, the most <em>valuable</em> sense, as had been seldom seen
since Dryden, never before, and in him not frequently. I do
not know in what language to look for a parallel wealth.
Systematic Hazlitt’s criticism very seldom is, and, as hinted
above, still seldomer at its best when it attempts system. But
then system was not wanted; it had been overdone; the
patient required a copious alterative. He received it from
Hazlitt as he has—virtue and quantity combined—received it
from no one else since: it is a “patent medicine” in everything
but the presence of quackery. Roughly speaking, Hazlitt’s
criticism is of two kinds. The first is very stimulating, very
interesting, but, I venture to think, the less valuable of the
two. In it Hazlitt at least endeavours to be general, and takes
a lesson from Burke in “prodigious variation” on his subject.
The most famous, the most laboured, and perhaps the best
example is the exordium of the <cite>Lectures on the English Poets</cite>,
with its astonishing “amplification” on what poetry in general
is and what it is not. A good deal of this is directly Coleridgean.
I forget whether this is the lecture which Coleridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>himself, when he read it, thought that he remembered
“talking at Lamb’s”; but we may be quite sure that he had
talked things very like it. Much in the “Shakespeare and
Milton” has the same quality, and may have been partly
derived from the same source: the critical character of Pope<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c010'><sup>[482]</sup></a>
is another instance, and probably more original. For Hazlitt
had not merely learnt the trick from his master but had himself
a genius for it; and he adorned these disquisitions with
more <em>phrase</em> than Coleridge’s recalcitrant pen usually allowed
him, though there seems to have been plenty in his speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Pope passage is specially interesting, because it leads us
to the second and, as it seems to me, the chief and principal
class of Hazlitt’s critical deliverances—those in which, without
<em>epideictic</em> intention, without, or with but a moderate portion
of, rhetoric and amplification and phrasemaking, he handles
separate authors and works and pieces. I have said that I
think him here unsurpassed, and perhaps unrivalled, in the
quantity and number of his deliverances, and only surpassed,
<em>if so</em>, in their quality, by the greatest things of the greatest
persons. These deliverances are to be found everywhere in
his extensive critical work, and it is of a survey of some of
them, conditioned in the manner outlined above, that the main
body of any useful historical account of his criticism must consist.
The four main places are the Lectures on <cite>The English
Poets</cite> (1818), on <cite>The English Comic Writers</cite> (1819), on <cite>Elizabethan
Literature</cite> (1820), and the book on <cite>Characters of Shakespeare</cite>
(1817). We may take them in the order mentioned,
though it is not quite chronological, because the chronological
dislocation, in the case of the second pair, is logically and
methodically unavoidable.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.69'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The English Poets.</div>

<p class='c001'>How thoroughly this examination of the greater particulars
(as we may call it) was the work which he was born to do is
illustrated by the sketches (at the end of the first
Lecture on <cite>The English Poets</cite><a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c010'><sup>[483]</sup></a>) of <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>,
<cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, the <cite>Decameron</cite>, Homer, the Bible, Dante,
and (O Groves of Blarney!) <cite>Ossian</cite>. Hazlitt’s faults (except
prejudice, which is here fortunately silent) are by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>hidden in them—irrelevance, defect of knowledge, “casualness,”
and other not so good things. But the <em>gusto</em>,<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c010'><sup>[484]</sup></a> the spirit, the
inspiriting quality, are present in tenfold measure. Here is a
man to whom literature is a real and live thing, and who can
make it real and alive to his readers—a man who does not
love it or its individual examples “by allowance,” but who
loves it “with personal love.” Even his Richardsonian digression<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c010'><sup>[485]</sup></a>—horrible
to the stop-watch man—is alive and real
and stimulating with the rest. The Dante passage is a little
false perhaps in parts, inadequate, prejudiced, what you will in
others. But it is criticism—an act of literary faith and hope
and charity too—a substance; something added to, and new-born
in, the literary cosmos. He is better (indeed he is here almost
at his very best) on Spenser than on Chaucer, but why? Because
he <em>knew</em> more about Spenser, because he was plentifully
read in sixteenth- and hardly read at all in fourteenth-century
literature. And so always: the very plethora of one’s notes
for comment warning the commentator that he is lost if he
indulges rashly. Where Hazlitt is inadequate (as for instance
on Dryden) he is more instructive than many men’s adequacy
could be, and where he is not—on Collins, on the Ballads, and
elsewhere—he prepares us for that ineffable and half-reluctant
outburst—a very Balaam’s blessing—on Coleridge,<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c010'><sup>[486]</sup></a> which
stands not higher than this, not lower than that, but as an
<span lang="la"><i>A-per-se</i></span>, consummate and unique.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.70'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Comic Writers.</div>

<p class='c001'>In a sense the <cite>Comic Writers</cite> are even better. The general
exordium on Wit and Humour belongs to the first class of
Hazlitt’s critical performances as defined above,
and is one of the cleverest of them; though it may
perhaps have the faults of its class, and some of those of its
author. That on Comedy—the general part of it—incurs this
sentence in a heavier degree; for Aristotle or somebody else
seems to have impressed Hazlitt too strongly with the necessary
<em>shadiness</em> of Comedy, and it is quite clear that of the Romantic
variety (which to be sure hardly anybody but Shakespeare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>has ever hit off) he had an insufficient idea. He is again inadequate
on Jonson; it is indeed in his criticism, because of
its very excellence, that we see—more than anywhere else,
though we see it everywhere—the truth of his master’s denunciation
of the “criticism which denies.” But his lecture
or essay on the capital examples of the comedy which he
really liked—that of the Restoration—is again an apex: and,
as it happens, it is grouped for English students with others—the
morally excellent and intellectually vigorous but rather
purblind onslaught of Collier, the again vigorous but somewhat
Philistine following thereof by Macaulay, the practical confession
of Lamb’s fantastic and delightful apology, Leigh Hunt’s
rather feeble compromise—after a fashion which shows it off to
a marvel. While as to the chapter on the Eighteenth-century
Novel it has, with a worthier subject, an equal supremacy of
treatment. You may differ with much of it, but always agree
to differ: except in that estimate of Lovelace which unfortunately
shows us Hazlitt’s inability to recognise a <em>cad</em> in the
dress and with the manners of a fine gentleman.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c010'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.71'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Age of Elizabeth.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Lectures on the Age of Elizabeth</cite> (which succeeded the
<cite>Comic Writers</cite>, as these had succeeded the <cite>Poets</cite>) maintain, if
they do not even raise, the standard. Perhaps there
is nothing so fine as the Coleridge passage in individual
and concentrated expression; nor any piece of connected
criticism so masterly as the chapter on the Novel. But
the level is higher: and nowhere do we find better expression
of that <em>gusto</em>—that amorous quest of literary beauty and rapturous
enjoyment of it—which, has been noted as Hazlitt’s
great merit. His faults are here, as always, with him and
with us. Even the faithful Lamb was driven to expostulate<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c010'><sup>[488]</sup></a>
with the wanton and, as it happens, most uncritical belittlement
of Sidney,<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c010'><sup>[489]</sup></a> and (though he himself was probably less
influenced by political partisanship or political feeling of any
kind than almost any great writer of whom we know) to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>assign this to its true cause. It is odd<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c010'><sup>[490]</sup></a> that a critic, and
a great critic, should contrive to be inadequate both on Browne
and on Dryden: and again one cannot but suspect the combination
to be due to the fact that both were Royalists. But
the King’s Head does not always come in: and it is only fair
to Hazlitt to say that he is less biassed than Coleridge by the
royalism itself of Beaumont and Fletcher, and the supposed
republicanism of Massinger. And in by far the greater part
of the book—nearly the whole of that part of it which deals
with the dramatists—there is no disturbance of this kind.
The opening, if somewhat discursive, is masterly, and with
very few exceptions the lecturer or essayist carries out the
admirable motto—in fact and in deed the motto of all real
critics—“I have endeavoured to feel what was good, and to
give a reason for the faith that was in me when necessary
and when in my power.”<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c010'><sup>[491]</sup></a> Two of his sentences, in dealing
with Beaumont and Fletcher, not merely set the key-note of
all good criticism but should open the stop thereof in all fit
readers. “It is something worth living for to write or even
read such poetry as this, or to know that it has been
written.” Again, “And so it is something, as our poets
themselves wrote, ‘far above singing.’”<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c010'><sup>[492]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.72'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Characters of Shakespeare.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays</cite> is perhaps not as good
as any of these three courses of Lectures; but it should be
remembered that it came earlier in time, and that
the critic had not “got his hand in.” The notes
are as a rule nearly as desultory as Coleridge’s,
with less suggestiveness; there is at least one outburst, in
the case of <cite>Henry V.</cite>, of the usual disturbing influence; there
is very much more quotation than there need be from Schlegel;
and there are other signs of the novitiate. Yet the book contains
admirable things, as in the early comparison of Chaucer
and Shakespeare, where, though Hazlitt’s defective knowledge
of Chaucer again appears, there is much else good. Among
the <span lang="la"><i>apices</i></span> of Shakespearian criticism is the statement that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>poet “has no prejudice for or against his characters,”<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c010'><sup>[493]</sup></a> that he
makes “no attempt to force an interest: everything is left for
time and circumstance to unfold.”<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c010'><sup>[494]</sup></a>  There is perhaps something
inconsistent with this as well as with truth in the
observation on <cite>Lear</cite>,<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c010'><sup>[495]</sup></a> that “He is here fairly caught in the
web of his own imagination”; but, like most of the greater
critics, Hazlitt cares very little for superficial consistency.
The characters of Falstaff and Shylock are masterpieces in his
<span lang="it"><i>bravura</i></span> style, and one need perhaps nowhere seriously quarrel
with any critical statement of his except the astonishing one,
that <cite>All’s Well that Ends Well</cite> is “one of the most <em>pleasing</em>”
of the plays.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the remaining volumes the literary articles or passages
are only occasional, and are often considerably adulterated
with non-literary matter.  In <cite>The Plain Speaker</cite>, for instance,
the opening paper on “The Prose Style of Poets” holds out
almost the highest promise, and gives almost the lowest performance.
Hazlitt, as is not so very uncommon with him,
seems to have deliberately set himself to take the other side
from Coleridge’s.  That it happens also to be the wrong side
matters very little.  But even his attack on Coleridge’s own
prose style (open enough to objection) has nothing very happy
in it except the comparison, “To read one of his disquisitions
is like hearing the variations to a piece of music without the
score.”  So, too, “On the Conversation of Authors,” though intensely
interesting, has no critical interest or very little—the
chief exception being the passage on Burke’s style.  Far
more important is the glance at the theory of the single word
in “On Application to Study,”<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c010'><sup>[496]</sup></a> and in that in “On Envy”<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c010'><sup>[497]</sup></a>
on the taste of the Lake School.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.73'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Plain Speaker.</div>

<p class='c001'>Much of <cite>The Plain Speaker</cite> is injured as a treasury of
criticism, though improved as a provision of amusement, by
Hazlitt’s personal revelations, complaints, agonies;
but the critical <em>ethos</em> of the man was so irrepressible
that it will not be refused.  There is a curious little piece<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c010'><sup>[498]</sup></a>
of critical blasphemy, or at least “dis-<em>gusto</em>” (the word is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>wanted and is fairly choice Italian), in “On the Pleasure of
Hating,” and, almost throughout the series, the sharp flux and
reflux of literary admiration and political rage in respect of
Scott is most noteworthy.  “On the Qualifications necessary
to Success in Life” contains yet another<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c010'><sup>[499]</sup></a> of those passages on
Coleridge which are like nothing so much as the half-fond,
half-furious, retrospects of a discarded lover on his mistress—which
are certainly like nothing else in literature. But “On
Reading Old Books” does not belie the promise of its title, and
is a complete and satisfactory palinode to the fit of critical
headache noted just now.  One must not venture to cite from
it; it is to be read and re-read, and hardly any single piece,
except the immortal “Farewell to Essay-Writing,” gives us so
much insight into Hazlitt’s critical temperament as this.  “On
People of Sense” contains many critical glances, and, unfortunately,
one<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c010'><sup>[500]</sup></a> of those on Shelley which show Hazlitt at his
worst.  One might think that he who found others so “far
above singing” could not miss the similar altitude of the
author of <cite>Prometheus Unbound</cite>.  But Shelley was a contemporary,
something of an acquaintance, a man of some means,
a gentleman—so Hazlitt must snarl<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c010'><sup>[501]</sup></a> at him.  Let us sigh and
pass.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Antiquity,” though on one side only, is almost throughout
ours, and therefore not ours: and there is not a little for us in
“On Novelty and Familiarity,” while “Old English Writers
and Speakers” speaks for itself, and is specially interesting
for its glances on matters French and its characteristically
Hazlittian fling—one I confess with which I have for once no
quarrel—that “<cite>’Tis pity She’s a Whore</cite> will no more act than
Lord Byron and Goethe together could have written it.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c010'><sup>[502]</sup></a>  It
puts one in charity for the absurd description,<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c010'><sup>[503]</sup></a> contradicted by</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>his own remarks, of <cite>Redgauntlet</cite>s “the last and almost worst”
of Scott’s novels, and the prediction (alas! to be falsified) that
“Old Sir Walter will last long enough”—in the flesh, not in
fame.<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c010'><sup>[504]</sup></a>  “Scott, Racine, and Shakespeare” is not unworthy of its
title, though it is really on the first and last only.  Racine is
brought in perfunctorily, and justice is done to him in neither
sense.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>Table-Talk</cite>, one of the greenest pastures of the Hazlittian
champaign generally, is among the least literary of the books,
and yet so literary enough.  “On Genius and Common Sense”
contributes its Character of Wordsworth,<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c010'><sup>[505]</sup></a> on whom Hazlitt
is always interesting, because of the extraordinary opposition
between the men’s temperaments.  The companion on Shelley,<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c010'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
which is supplied by “On Paradox and Commonplace,” is
hardly less interesting, though, for the reasons above indicated,
much less valuable.  “On Milton’s Sonnets,” however, is, as it
ought to be, a pure study and an admirable one.<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c010'><sup>[507]</sup></a>  “The Aristocracy
of Letters” carries its hay high on the horn, yet it
is not negligible: and “On Criticism,” which follows, really
deserves the title, despite its frequent and inevitable flings
and runnings-amuck.  The good-humoured, though rather
“home” description of “the Occult School”<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c010'><sup>[508]</sup></a> (<i>v. supra</i> on
Lamb) is perfectly just.  “On Familiar” Style is also no
false promiser, and yet another passage on Coleridge meets
us in the paper “On Effeminacy of Character.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.74'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Round Table, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nor is the interesting “omnibus” volume, which takes its
general title from <cite>The Round Table</cite>, of the most fertile.  The
collection of short papers, properly so called, was
written earlier (1817) than most of the books
hitherto discussed, and therefore has some first drafts or variants
of not a little that is in them.  In a note of it<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c010'><sup>[509]</sup></a> occurs the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>passage on Burke, which, with that on Scott in the <cite>Spirit of
the Age</cite>, is Hazlitt’s nearest approach to the sheer <span lang="la"><i>delirium
tremens</i></span> of the Gifford Letter: but he is not often thus. “The
Character of Milton’s Eve” is a fine critical paper of its kind,
and “takes the taste out” well after the passage on Burke.
The long handling of <cite>The Excursion</cite> is very interesting to
compare with that in the <cite>English Poets</cite>, as is the earlier
“Midsummer Night’s Dream” with similar things elsewhere.
“Pedantry” and others give something: and though no human
being (especially no human being who knows both books)
has ever discovered what made Hazlitt call <cite>John Buncle</cite> “the
English Rabelais,” the paper on Amory’s queer novel is a
very charming one. “On the Literary Character” does somewhat
deceive us: “Commonplace Critics” less so: but to
“Poetical Versatility” we must return. Of the remaining
contents of the volume, the well-known <cite>Conversations with
Northcote</cite> (where the painter plays Hazlitt’s idea of an Advocatus
Diaboli on Hazlitt) gives less still. But there is a
striking passage on Wordsworth,<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c010'><sup>[510]</sup></a> a paradox (surely?) on Tom
Paine<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c010'><sup>[511]</sup></a> as “a fine writer” (you might as well call a good
getter of coal at the face “a fine sculptor”), an interesting
episode<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c010'><sup>[512]</sup></a> on early American nineteenth-century literature;
and not a few others, especially the profound self-criticism
(for no doubt Northcote had nothing to do with it) on Hazlitt’s

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, <cite>The Spirit of the Age</cite> (with the exception

literary; and may rank with the three sets of <cite>Lectures</cite>
and the <cite>Characters of Shakespeare</cite> as the main storehouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of Hazlitt’s criticism. Here, too, there is much repetition,
and here, at the end of the Scott article, is the almost insane
outburst more than once referred to. But the bulk of the
book is at Hazlitt’s very best pitch of appreciative grasp.
If he is anywhere out of focus, it is in reference to Godwin’s
novels—the setting of which in any kind of comparison with
Scott’s (though Hazlitt was critic enough from the first to
see that Godwin could by no possibility be the “Author of
<cite>Waverley</cite>”) is a remarkable instance of the disadvantage of
the contemporary, and, to some extent, the sympathiser. But
the book certainly goes far to bear out the magnificent eulogy
of Hazlitt for which Thackeray<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c010'><sup>[515]</sup></a> took it as text, quite early
in his career.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.76'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Sketches and Essays.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Sketches and Essays</cite> are again very rich, where they are
rich; and advertise the absence of riches most frankly where
they are not. “On Reading New Books”; not a
little of “Merry England”; the whole of “On
Taste” and “Why the Heroes of Romances are insipid” speak
for themselves, and do not bewray their claim. “Taste,” especially,
contains<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c010'><sup>[516]</sup></a> one of Hazlitt’s own titles to critical supremacy
in his fixing on Perdita’s primrose description as itself supreme,
when “the scale of fancy, passion, and observation of nature
is  raised”  high enough. <a id='sec8.1.77'></a><span class='sni side7'>Winterslow.</span> And as for <cite>Winterslow</cite>,
its first and its last papers are “things enskied”
in criticism, for the one is “My First Acquaintance with

<p class='c009'>and (say) the paper referred to a little above  on “Poetical
Versatility,” will serve as texts for some more general remarks
on Hazlitt’s critical character. We have said at
the beginning of this notice everything that need
be said by way of deduction or allowance; we have
only hinted  at the clear critical “balance to credit” which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>remains; and these essays and passages will help to bring
this out.</p>

<p class='c001'>To take the “Poetic Versatility” first, it is an interesting
paper, and with the aid of those “characters” of poets, &#38;c.,
which have been indicated in the survey just completed, gives
the best possible idea of one (and perhaps the most popular) of
Hazlitt’s forms of critical achievement and influence. In it
he eddies round his subject—completing his picture of it by
strokes apparently promiscuous in selection, but always tending
to body forth the image that presents itself to him, and that
he wishes to present to his readers. “Poetry dwells in a
perpetual Utopia of its own.” It “does not create difficulties
where they do not exist, but contrives to get rid of them
whether they exist or not.” “Its strength is in its wings; its
element the air.” We “may leave it to time to take out the
stains, seeing it is a thing immortal as itself.” Poets “either
find things delightful or make them so,” &#38;c. &#38;c., some of the
etceteras drawing away from the everlasting, and condescending
rather lamentably to the particular.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.79'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>in set pieces,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Now there is no need to tell the reader—even the reader of
this book, I hope—that this, of these utterances, is a reproduction
of Longinus (whom Hazlitt most probably
had not read), or that of Coleridge, whom most
certainly he had both read and heard.<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c010'><sup>[517]</sup></a> “The man who plants
cabbages imitates too”: and it is only the foolishest folk of
rather foolish times who endeavour to be original, though the
wisest of all times always succeed in being so. The point with
Hazlitt is that in these circlings round his subject—these
puttings of every possible way in which, with or without the
help of others, it strikes him—he gives the greatest possible
help to others in being struck. One of the blows will almost
certainly hit the nail on the head and drive it home into any
tolerably susceptible mind: many may, and the others after
the first will help to fix it. Of method there may not be very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>much—there is rather more here than in most cases; but
whether there is method or not, “everything,” in the old military
phrase, “goes in”; the subject and the reader are carried
by assault, mass, variety, repetition of argument, imagery,
phrase.  Hazlitt will not be refused; he takes towns at a
hand-gallop, like Condé at Lerida—and he does not often lose
them afterwards.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.80'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>and universally.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In this phase of his genius, however, there is perhaps, for
some tastes at any rate, a little too much of what has been
called <span lang="it"><cite>bravura</cite></span>—too much of the merely epideictic.
It is not so in the other.  Appreciate the appreciation
of the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> passage; still more take to heart
(they will go to it without much taking where there is one)
the “First Acquaintance with Poets,” or still better the
marvellous critical swan-song of the “Farewell,” and there
can be no more doubt about Hazlitt.  <span lang="la"><i>Quia multum amavit</i></span> is
at once his best description and his greatest glory.  In all
the range of criticism which I have read I can hardly think of
any one except Longinus who displays the same faculty of
not unreasonable or unreasoned passion for literature; and
Longinus, alas! has, as an opportunity for showing this to us,
scarcely more than the bulk of one of Hazlitt’s longest Essays,
of which, long and short, Hazlitt himself has given us, I suppose,
a hundred.  Nor, as in some others (many, if not most of whom,
if I named them, I should name for the sake of honour), is a
genuine passion made the mere theme of elaborate and deliberate
literary variations.  As we have seen, Hazlitt will
often leave it expressed in one sentence of ejaculatory and
convincing fervour; it seldom appears at greater length than
that of a passage, while a whole lecture or essay in the key of
rapture is exceedingly rare.  Hazlitt is desultory, irrelevant,
splenetic, moody, self-contradictory; but he is never merely
pleonastic,—there is no mere verbiage, no mere virtuosity,
in him.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the consequence is that this enthusiastic appreciation
of letters, which I have, however heretically, taken throughout
this book to be really the highest function of criticism,
<em>catches</em>: that the critical yeast (to plagiarise from ourselves)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>never fails to work.  The order of history, as always, should
probably be repeated, and the influence of Coleridge should be
felt, as Hazlitt himself felt it, first: it is well to fortify also with
Longinus himself, and with Aristotle, and with as many others
of the great ones as the student can manage to master.  But
there is at least a danger, with some perhaps of not the worst
minds, of all this remaining cold as the bonfire before the torch
is applied.  The <span lang="la"><i>silex scintillans</i></span> of Hazlitt’s rugged heart will
seldom fail to give the vivifying spark from its own inward
and immortal fire.<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c010'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.81'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Blake.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There have been times—perhaps they are not quite over—when
the admission of William Blake<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c010'><sup>[519]</sup></a> into the category
of critics would have been regarded as an absurdity,
or a bad jest.  Nothing is more certain, however,
than that the poet-painter expresses, with a force and directness
rather improved by that lack of complete technical
sanity which some of his admirers most unwisely and needlessly
deny, the opinions of the “Extreme Right,” the high-fliers
of the Army of Romanticism.  He may often be thinking
of painting rather than of poetry; but this is sometimes
expressedly not the case, and many of his most pointed
sayings apply to the one art just as well as to the other—if
indeed it would not be still more correct to say that, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>when they concern mere technique, they always apply to both.
His work, despite the attention which it has received from
hands, sometimes of the most eminent, during the last forty
years, <a id='note267.4'></a><a href='#n_267.4'><ins class='note'>has never yet been edited</ins></a> in a fashion making its
chaos cosmic or the threading of its labyrinths easy: and
it may be well to bring together some of the most noteworthy
critical expressions in it.  That which has been referred to
in a former passage,<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c010'><sup>[520]</sup></a> “Every man is a judge of pictures who
has not been connoisseured out of his senses,”<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c010'><sup>[521]</sup></a> is in itself
almost a miniature manifesto of the new school of criticism.
For “connoisseurship”—the regular training in the orthodox
system of judgment by rule and line and pattern—is substituted
the impression of the natural man, unconditioned except by
the retirement that it <em>shall</em> be impression, and not prejudice.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.82'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His critical position and dicta.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>So, again, that remarkable expression of the Prophet Isaiah<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c010'><sup>[522]</sup></a>
when, as Blake casually mentions, he and Ezekiel “dined
with me”—an occasion on which surely any one
of taste would like to have completed the quartette.
The poet-host tells us that he asked, “Does a firm
persuasion that a thing is so make it so?” and that the
prophet-guest answered, “All poets believe that it does”—a
position from which La Harpism and the reluctance to
“surrender disbelief” are at once crushed, concluded, and
quelled.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the remarkable engraved page on Homer and Virgil,<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c010'><sup>[523]</sup></a>
Blake adventures himself (not with such rashness as may
at first seem) against Aristotle (or what he takes for Aristotle),
by laying it down that Unity and Morality belong to philosophy,
not poetry, or at least are secondary in the latter; that goodness
and badness are not distinctions of “character” (a saying
in which there is some quibbling but much depth as well);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>that the Classics, not Goths or Monks, “desolate Europe with
wars” (a great enough dictum at the junction of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries); and that “Grecian wit is mathematical
form,” which is only “eternal in the reasoning memory,”
while Gothic is “living form, that is to say, eternal existence”—perhaps
the deepest saying of the whole, though it wants
large allowance and intelligent taking.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Notes on Reynolds” are naturally full of our stuff.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is worth while to add to these the very remarkable
annotations upon Wordsworth’s Prefaces: “I don’t know
who wrote these: they are very mischievous, and
direct contrary to Wordsworth’s own practice”
[where if Blake had added the words “when he is a poet,”
he would simply have given the conclusion of the whole
matter], with the very shrewd addendum that Wordsworth
is not so much attacking poetic diction, or defending his own,
as “vindicating unpopular poets.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.85'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Commanding position of these.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Scanty as this critical budget may seem, its individual items
are of extraordinary weight, when we remember that some
of them were written before the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>
themselves appeared, and all of them by a
man of hardly any reading in contemporary literature,
and quite out of the circle of Coleridgean influence.  It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>is scarcely, if at all, too much to say that they are almost
enough to start, in a fit mind, the whole system of Romantic
criticism in its more abstract form, and sometimes even in
its particular and concrete applications.  All the eighteenth-century
Dagons—the beliefs in official connoisseurship, in
the unapproachable supremacy of the ancients, in the barbarism
and foolishness of Gothic art and literature, in the
superiority of the general to the particular, in the necessity
of extracting central forms and holding to them, in the
supremacy of reason, in the teachableness of poetry, in the
virtues of copying, in the superiority of design to execution,—all
are tumbled off their pedestals with the most irreverent
violence.  That the critic’s applications in the sister art to
Rubens, to Titian, to Reynolds himself, are generally unjust,
and not infrequently the result of pure ignorance, does not
matter; his own formulas would often correct him quite as
thoroughly as those of the classical school.  What is important
is his discovery and enunciation of these formulas themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>For by them, in place of these battered gods of the classical
or neo-classical Philistia, are set up Imagination for Reason,
Enthusiasm for Good Sense, the Result for the Rule; the
execution for the mere conception or even the mere selection
of subject; impression for calculation; the heart and the eyes
and the pulses and the fancy for the stop-watch and the
boxwood measure and the table of specifications.  It is not
necessary to argue the question whether Blake’s own poetical
work (we are not concerned with his pictorial) justifies or
disconcerts the theories under which it was composed; it may
be very strongly suspected, from utterances new as well as old,
that approval of the theory and approval of the practice, as
well as disapproval in each case, are too intimately bound up
with each other to make appeal to either much of an argument.
But for our main purpose, which is purely historical, the
importance of Blake should, even in these few pages, have been
put out of doubt.  In no contemporary—not in Coleridge
himself—is the counter-creed to that of the Neo-classics
formulated with a sharper precision, and withal a greater width
of inclusion and sweep.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span></div>
<a id='sec8.1.86'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sir Walter Scott commonly undervalued as a critic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There are more senses than one (or for the matter of that
two) in the famous proverb, “The better is the enemy of the
good.”  And in one of them, though not the
commonest, it is eminently true of the criticism of
Sir Walter Scott.  No one, of course, would give to
Scott any such relative rank as a critic as that
which is his due either as poet or as novelist; but the extent
to which his fame as poet and novelist has obscured his
reputation as critic is altogether disproportionate and unfair.
It is even doubtful whether some tolerably educated persons
ever think of him as a critic at all.  For his so-called “Prose
Works” (except <cite>Tales of a Grandfather</cite>) are very little read,
and as usual the criticism is the least read part of them.  Yet
it is a very large part—extending, what with the Lives of <em>Swift</em>
and <em>Dryden</em>, the shorter “<cite>Biographies</cite>,” the <cite>Chivalry, Romance,
and Drama</cite>, and the collection or selection of <cite>Periodical
Criticism</cite>, to ten pretty solid volumes, while even this excludes
a great amount of critical matter in the notes and Introductions
to the <cite>Poems</cite>, the Novels, the <cite>Dryden</cite> and <cite>Swift</cite> themselves,
and other by-works of Sir Walter’s gigantic industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mere bulk, however, it may be said, is nothing—indeed it
is too often, in work of which posterity is so shy as it is of
criticism, a positive misfortune and drawback.  What makes
the small account taken of Scott as a critic surprising and
regrettable is the goodness as well as the bulk of his critical
production.  Perhaps it may be urged with some justice, in
defence of this popular neglect, that his want of attention to
style is particularly unfortunate here.  He is notoriously a
rather “incorrect” writer; and he does not, as many so-called
incorrect writers have known how to do, supply the want of
academic propriety by irregular brilliances of any kind.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.87'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Injustice of this.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Another charge sometimes brought against him—that he is
too good-natured and too indiscriminate in praise—will less hold
water;<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c010'><sup>[524]</sup></a> and indeed is much too closely connected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>popular notion of the critic as a sort of “nigger”-overseer,
whose business is to walk about and distribute lashes—a
notion which cannot be too often reprobated.
As a private critic Scott <em>was</em> sometimes too easy-going, but
by no means always or often in his professional utterances.
And he had what are certainly two of the greatest requirements
of the critic, reading and sanity.  Sometimes some amiable
prepossession (such as the narrower patriotism in his relative
estimate of Fielding and Smollett) leads him a little astray;
but this is very seldom—far seldomer than is the rule with
critics of anything like his range.  Here, as elsewhere, he does
not much affect the larger and deeper and higher generalisations;
but here, as elsewhere, his power of reaching these has
been considerably underrated.  And the distaste itself saves
him—and his readers—from the hasty and floundering failures
of those who aim more ambitiously at width, depth, and height.
In the methodic grasp and orderly exposition of large and
complicated subjects (as in the <em>Romance</em><a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c010'><sup>[525]</sup></a> and <em>Drama</em> examples)
he leaves nothing to desire.  Sometimes, in his regular
reviews, he condescends too much to the practice of making
the review a mere abstract of the book; but I have known
readers who complain bitterly of any other mode of proceeding.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, in two most important divisions of the critic’s art
Scott has very few superiors.  These are the appreciation
of particular passages, books, and authors, and the writing
of those critical biographies which Dryden first essayed in
English, and of which Johnson is the acknowledged master.
The Prefaces to the Ballantyne Novels<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c010'><sup>[526]</sup></a> are the best among
Scott’s good things in this kind on the small scale, as the
<em>Dryden</em> and the <em>Swift</em> are on the great: for evidences of
the former excellence the reader has only to open any one
of the half-score volumes referred to above.  And those golden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>qualities of heart which accompanied his genius are illustrated,
as well as that genius itself, in his frequent critical writing
on other novelists. The criticism of creators on their fellows
is not always pleasant reading, except for those who delight
to study the weaknesses of the <span lang="de"><cite>verdammte Race</cite></span>. Scott criticises
great and small among the folk of whom he is the king, from
the commonest romancer up to Jane Austen, with equal generosity,
acuteness, and technical mastery. Nor ought we, in
this necessarily inadequate sketch, to omit putting in his
cap the feather so often to be refused to critics—the feather
of catholicity. Macaulay could not praise the delightful lady,
whom both he and Scott did their utmost to celebrate, without
throwing out a fling at <em>Sintram</em>, as if there were no room for
good things of different kinds in the great region of Romance.
In Scott’s works you may find,<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c010'><sup>[527]</sup></a> literally side by side, and
characterised by equal critical sense, the eulogy of <cite>Persuasion</cite>

<a id='sec8.1.88'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Campbell: his</i> Lectures on Poetry.</div>

<p class='c001'>Campbell’s critical work is chiefly concentrated in two
places, one of them accessible with some difficulty, the other
only too accessible after a fashion. The first is
the <cite>Lectures on Poetry</cite>, which, after delivering them
at the Royal Institution during the great vogue of
such things in 1820, he refashioned later for the <cite>New Monthly
Magazine</cite> when he was its editor, so that they are only to
be had by one of the least <a id='corr272.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='agreeeable'>agreeable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_272.25'><ins class='correction' title='agreeeable'>agreeable</ins></a></span> of all processes, the
rummaging <em>for a purpose</em> in an old periodical.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.89'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His</i> Specimens.</div>

<p class='c001'>The accessibility of the other place—the  critical matter
contributed to the well-known <cite>Specimens of the British Poets</cite>,
and to some extent the actual selections themselves—is
greater because they are in nearly all the
second-hand book-shops, where from sixpence to a shilling a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>volume will buy—well bound often and in perfectly good condition—matter
which, at any proper ratio of exchange, is worth
a dozen times the money.  This worth consists of course mainly
in the matter selected: but the taste which selected it must
figure for no small increment, and the purely critical framework
is, to say the least, remarkably worthy of both.
Campbell, a very puzzling person in his poetry, is by no
means a very easily comprehensible or appraisable one in his
critical attitude.  In the general arrangement of this he is
distinctly of the older fashion, as the fashions of his time
went.  Like his style, though this is a very fair specimen
of the “last Georgian,” still in a manner the standard and
staple of the plainer English prose, his opinions are a thought
periwigged and buckrammed.  He demurs to the “Romantic
Unity” of Hurd earlier and Schlegel later; and when in his
swashing blow (and a good swashing blow it is of its kind)
on the side of Pope in the weary quarrel, he tries to put
treatment of artificial on a poetical level with treatment of
natural objects, we must demur pretty steadily ourselves.
But, on the other hand, he distinctly champions (and was,
I believe, the first actually so to formulate) the principle that
“in poetry there are many mansions,” and, what is more, he
lives up to it.  He really and almost adequately appreciates
Chaucer: it is only his prejudice about Unity and the Fable
that prevents him from being a thorough-going Spenserian;
and when we come to the seventeenth century he is quite
surprising. Again, it is true, his <em>general</em> creed makes him
declare that the metaphysicians “thought like madmen.”  But
he is juster to some of them than Hazlitt is; he has the great
credit of having (after a note of Southey’s, it is true) re-introduced
readers to the mazy but magical charms of <cite>Pharonnida</cite>;
and he admits Godolphin and Stanley, Flatman and
Ayres.  If the history of the earlier part of his Introductory
Essay is shaky, it could not have been otherwise in his time;
and it shows that the indolence with which he is so often
charged did not prevent him from making a very good use
of what Warton and Percy, Tyrwhitt and Ritson and Ellis,
had provided.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>This indolence, however, is perhaps more evident in the
distribution of the criticism, which, if not careless, is exceedingly
capricious.  Campbell seems at first to have intended
to concentrate this criticism proper in the Introduction (to
which nearly the whole of the first volume is allotted), and
to make the separate prefaces to the selections mainly biographical.
But he does not at all keep to this rule; the main
<cite>Introduction</cite> itself is, if anything, rather too copious at the
beginning, while it is compressed and hurried at the end: not
a few of the minor pieces and less prominent poets have no
criticism at all; while, in the case of those that have it, it
is often extremely difficult to discover the principle of its
allotment.  Yet, on the whole, Campbell ought never to be
neglected by the serious student; for even if his criticism were
solely directed from an obsolete standpoint, it would be well
to go back to it now and then as a half-way house between
those about Johnson and those about Coleridge, while as a
matter of fact it has really a very fair dose of universal quality.<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c010'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.90'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Shelley: his</i> Defence of Poetry.</div>

<p class='c001'>There are several critical passages in Shelley’s <cite>Letters</cite>, but,
as formally preserved, his criticism is limited to the <cite>Defence of
Poetry</cite>, which, despite its small bulk, is of extreme
interest.<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c010'><sup>[530]</sup></a>  It is almost the only return of its times
to that extremely abstract consideration of the
matter which we found prevalent in the Renaissance, and
which in Shelley’s case, as in the cases of Fracastoro or of
Sidney, is undoubtedly inspired by Plato.  It seems to have
been immediately prompted by some heresies of Peacock’s:
but, as was always its author’s habit, in prose as well as in
verse, he drifts “away, afar” from what apparently was his
starting-point, over a measureless ocean of abstract thinking.
He endeavours indeed, at first, to echo the old saws about men
“imitating natural objects in the youth of the world” and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>like, but he does not in any way keep up the arrangement, and
we are almost from the outset in contact with his own ardent
imagination—of which quality he at once defines poetry as
the expression. Again, the poetic faculty is “the faculty of
approximation to the beautiful.” Once more we have the
proud claim for poetry that poets are not merely the authors
of arts, but the inventors of laws, the teachers of religion.
They “participate in the eternal, the infinite, and the one.”
They are not necessarily confined to verse, but they will be
wise to use it. A poem is the very image of life, expressed in
its eternal truth. “Poetry is something divine,” the “centre
and circumference of knowledge,” the “perfect and consummate
surface and bloom of all things,” the “record of the best and
happiest moments of the happiest and best minds.” All which
(or all except the crotchet about verse) I for one do most
powerfully and potently believe: though if any one says that,
as generally with Shelley, one is left stranded, or rather floating,
in the vague, denial is not easy. One can only wish oneself,
as Poins wished his sister, “no worse fortune.”<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c010'><sup>[531]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.91'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Landor.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the course of this History we have seen not infrequent
examples of Criticism divorced from Taste—a severance to
which the peculiarities of classical and neo-classical
censorship lent but too much encouragement.  It
must be obvious that the general tendency of the criticism
which we are calling Modern inclines towards the divorce of
Taste from Criticism—to the admission of the monstrous
regiment of mere arbitrary enjoyment and liking, not to say
mere caprice.  But it is curious that our first very distinguished
example of this should be found in a person who,
both by practice and in theory, had very distinct “classical”
tendencies—who, in fact, with the possible exception of Mr
Arnold, was the most classical of at least the English writers
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.92'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His lack of judicial quality.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Landor’s<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c010'><sup>[532]</sup></a> critical shortcomings, however, are the obvious
and practically inevitable result of certain well-known
peculiarities of temperament, moral rather than
intellectual, and principles of life rather than of
literature.  With him, as with King Lear (whom
in more ways and points than one he resembled, though, luckily,
with the tragedy infinitely softened and almost smoothed
away), the dominant is <span lang="la"><i>impotentia</i></span>—the increasing and at last
absolute incapacity of the intellect and will to govern the
emotions and impulses.  Now, as criticism is itself an endless
process of correcting impressions—or at least of checking and
auditing them till we are sure that they are genuine, co-ordinated,
and (with the real if not the apparent consistency) consistent—a
man who suffers from this <span lang="la"><i>impotentia</i></span> simply cannot
be a real critic, though he may occasionally make observations
critically sound.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.93'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>In regular Criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The rule and the exceptions hold good with Landor unfailingly.
He was an excellent scholar; his acquaintance with
modern literatures, though  much smaller and extremely
arbitrary, was not positively small, and
his taste, in some directions at least, was delicate and exquisite.
But of judicial quality or qualities he had not one single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>trace, and, even putting them out of the question, his intelligence
was streaked and flawed by strange veins of positive
silliness.  We need not dwell too much on his orthographical
and other whims, which have been shared by some great ones—the
judgments are the things.  In the very first paragraph
of his very first regular criticism we find the statement that
the Poems of Bion and Moschus are not only “very different”
from those of Theocritus but “very inferior.”  Inferior in
what? in bulk certainly: but in what else are the <cite>Adonis</cite>
and the <cite>Bion</cite> itself inferior to anything Theocritean?  A
critic should have been warned by his own “different” not
to rush on the “inferior,” which is so often fallaciously consequent.
I shall not be accused of excessive Virgil-worship,
but what criticism is there in the objection to <span lang="la"><i>me ceperat annus</i></span>
as “scarcely Latin” (really! really! Mr Landor, you were
not quite a Pollio!), and in the flat emendation of <span lang="la"><i>mihi coeperat</i></span>;
or in the contemptuous treatment of that exquisite piece containing</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>a phrase which, for simplicity, pictorial effect, and suggestion,
is almost worthy of Sappho?  Such a sentence as that
of Politian’s poems, “one only has any merit,” is simply
disabling: mere schoolboy prejudice has evidently blinded
the speaker.  Yet it occurs in his best critique, that on
Catullus.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.94'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Conversations.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These set criticisms, however, are few, and Landor was
evidently not at ease in them.  The literary “Conversations,”
it may be said, are the true test.  And it is at
least certain that these conversations supply not
a few of those more excellent critical observations which have
been acknowledged and saluted.  Especially must we acknowledge
and salute one<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c010'><sup>[533]</sup></a> which, though of considerable length,
must be made an exception to the rule of “not quoting.”
Nowhere, in ancient or modern place, is the education of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>critic outlined with greater firmness and accuracy; and those
who, by this or that good fortune, have been put through
some such a process, may congratulate themselves on having
learnt no vulgar art in no vulgar way.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.95'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Loculus aureolus.</i></div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>l would seriously recommend to the employer of our critics,
young and old, that he oblige them to pursue a course of study
such as this; that, under the superintendence of some
respectable student from the University, they first read
and examine the contents of the book—a thing greatly
more useful in criticism than is generally thought; secondly, that
they carefully write them down, number them, and range them
under their several heads; thirdly, that they mark every beautiful,
every faulty, every ambiguous, every uncommon expression. Which
being completed, that they inquire what author, ancient or modern,
has treated the same subject; that they compare them, first in
smaller, afterwards in larger portions, noting every defect in precision
and its causes, every excellence and its nature; that they
graduate these, fixing <em>plus</em> and <em>minus</em>, and designating them more accurately
and discriminately by means of colours stronger or paler.
For instance purple might express grandeur and majesty of thought;
scarlet, vigour of expression; pink, liveliness; green, elegant and
equable composition; these, however, and others as might best
attract their notice and serve their memory. The same process
may be used where authors have not written on the same subject,
when those who have are wanting or have touched on it but
incidentally. Thus Addison and Fontenelle, not very like, may
be compared in the graces of style, in the number and degree of
just thoughts and lively fancies; thus the dialogues of Cicero with
those of Plato, his ethics with those of Aristotle, his orations
with those of Demosthenes. It matters not if one be found
superior to the other in this thing and inferior in that: the
qualities of two authors are explored and understood and their
distances laid down, as geographers speak, from accurate survey.
The <em>plus</em> and <em>minus</em> of good and bad and ordinary will have something
of a scale to rest upon: and after a time the degrees of the
higher parts in intellectual dynamics may be more nearly attained,
though never quite exactly.</p>

</div>

<a id='sec8.1.96'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>But again disappointing.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet in close context with this very passage comes an idle
“splurt” (evidently half-due to <span lang="la"><i>odium anti-theologicum</i></span>)
at Coleridge—a thing exactly of the kind
which such discipline as has been just recommended
should check. And everywhere, especially in the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Miltonic examen between “Southey and Landor,” the effects
of Landor’s character appear side by side with a sort of peddling
and niggling censorship which one might have thought not
natural to that character at all, and which perhaps is a
<span lang="la"><i>damnosa hereditas</i></span> from the worse kind of classical scholarship.
Even on Boileau<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c010'><sup>[534]</sup></a> he manages to be unfair; and at his objection

<p class='c009'>one can but cover the face. Caprice, arbitrary legislation,
sometimes positive blindness and deafness,—these are Landor’s
critical marks when he quits pure theory, and sometimes when
he does not quit it.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.97'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The revival of the Pope quarrels.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With him we leave the “majorities”—those who, whether
greater or lesser critics, were great either as such or in other
paths of letters. Some smaller, but in some cases
not so small, persons remain, with one or two examples—one
specially famous—of what we have
called “the Adversaries.” And first we must touch (if only in
order to deal with yet another of the majorities themselves,
who has seemed to some to be a critic) on the “Pope a Poet”
quarrel.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.98'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Bowles.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We have seen<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c010'><sup>[535]</sup></a> that this quarrel, originally raised by Joseph
Warton, was even by him latterly waged as by one <span lang="la"><i>cauponans
bellum</i></span>; but a lazily and gingerly waged war is
generally a long one, and this instance did not
discredit the rule. Johnson’s intervention<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c010'><sup>[536]</sup></a> in it, in his <cite>Life</cite>
of Pope, was sensible and moderate—indeed, with certain
necessary allowances, it is fairly decisive. But Pope, among
his other peculiarities, has had the fate of making foes of his
editors, and this was the case with the Reverend William Lisle
Bowles, who revived the fainting battle,<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c010'><sup>[537]</sup></a> not to any one’s
advantage or particular credit, and to his own dire tribulation.
Bowles is one of those not uninteresting people, in all divisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of history, who, absolutely rather null, have not inconsiderable
relative importance. The influence of his early sonnets on
Coleridge, and through Coleridge on the whole Romantic revival
in England, is well known, and not really surprising. In the
remainder of his long and on the whole blameless life, he committed
a great deal of verse which, though not exactly bad,
is utterly undistinguished and unimportant. His theory of
poetry, however, though somewhat one-sided, was better than
his practice: and it was rather as a result of that dangerous
thing Reaction, and from a lack of alertness and catholicity,
than from positive heresy, that he fell foul of Pope. In his
edition he laid down, and in the controversy following he
defended,<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c010'><sup>[538]</sup></a> certain “invariable principles of Poetry,” of which
the first and foremost was that images, thoughts, &#38;c., derived
from Nature and Passion, are always more sublime and pathetic
than those drawn from Art and Manners. And it was chiefly
on this ground that he, of course following his leader Warton,
but using newer material and tactics, disabled, partially or
wholly, the claims of Pope. Hereupon arose a hubbub.
Campbell in the <cite>Specimens</cite><a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c010'><sup>[539]</sup></a> took a hand; Byron wrote a <cite>Letter
to John Murray</cite><a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c010'><sup>[540]</sup></a> in defence of his favourite, and in ridicule
of Bowles; auxiliaries and adversaries ran up on both sides.
Whether Bowles was most happy or unhappy in the turmoil
I am unable to say, but he was certainly put in a great state
of agitation, and showered Pamphlets with elaborate titles,
which one may duly find, with their occasions and rejoinders,
in the library of the British Museum. At last dust settled
on the conflict, which, however, is itself not quite settled to
the present day, and in fact never can be, because it depends
on one of the root differences of poetical taste. However,
it probably helped the wiser sort to take the <span lang="la"><i>via media</i></span>, even
such a Romantic as Hazlitt vindicating Pope’s possession of
“the poetical point of view,” and did, for the same sort, a
service to the general history of criticism by emphasising the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>above-mentioned difference. Bowles himself, if he had been
less fussy, less verbose, less given to “duply and quadruply”
on small controversial points, and more a man of the world
and of humour, might not have made by any means a bad
critic. As it was, he was right in the main.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.99'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Byron.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We must, however, I suppose, say something, if only in this
connection, of Byron as a critic. I do not think it necessary
to say very much; and I shall not, as I could most
easily do, concatenate here the innumerable contradictions
of critical opinion in his <cite>Letters</cite>, which show that
they were mere flashes of the moment, connected not merely
by no critical theory but by no critical taste of any consistency,
flings, “half-bricks” directed at dog or devil or divinity, according
to the mood in which the “noble poet” chose to find
himself. <a id='sec8.1.100'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The</i> Letter to Murray, <i>&#38;c.</i></span> Let us confine ourselves to that unquestionably
remarkable <cite>Letter to John Murray</cite> on Bowles and
Pope, which is admittedly his critical diploma-piece.
There are of course very good things in it. Byron
was a genius; and your genius will say genial things now
and then, whatsoever subject he happens to be treating. But
he cannot in the very least maintain himself at the critical
point: he is like the ball in the fountain, mounting now and
then gloriously on the summit of the column and catching
the rays that it attracts and reflects, much more often lying
wallowing in the basin. Never was such critical floundering.
He blasphemes at one moment the “invariable principles of
poetry,” about which the amiable but somewhat ineffectual
Bowles prated; he affirms them at the next, by finding in his
way, and blindly picking up, the secret of secrets, that the poet
who <em>executes</em> best is the highest, whatsoever his department;
and he makes his affirmation valueless, by saying, almost before
we have turned the page, that Lucretius is ruined by his ethics,
and Pope saved by them. Even setting ethic against ethic,
the proposition is at least disputable: but what on earth has
Ethic to do with Execution, except that they both occur in
the dictionary under E? There are other excellent things
in the letter, and yet others the reverse of excellent; but I
have not the least intention here of setting up a balance-sheet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>after the manner of Robinson Crusoe, of ranging Byron’s undoubtedly
true, though not novel, vindication of the human
element as invariably necessary to poetry, against his opinion
of Shelley, and of Keats, and of the English poetry of his
greatest contemporaries generally, as “all Claudian,” and
against the implied estimate of Claudian himself. This would
be a confusion like his own, a parallel <span lang="la"><i>ignoratio elenchi</i></span>, a
<span lang="la"><i>fallacia a fallacioribus</i></span>. Suffice it to say, that to take him
seriously as a critic is impossible.<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c010'><sup>[541]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.101'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Others: Isaac Disraeli.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the work which—sometimes of the inner citizenship of
the critical Rome and at the worst of its “utmost last provincial
band”—was done by a great number of
individuals and in no small number of periodicals,
dictionaries, and what not, we cannot speak here
as fully as would be pleasant,—the historian must become
a “reasoned cataloguer” merely, and that by selection. Two
contemporary and characteristic figures are those of Isaac
Disraeli and of Sir Egerton Brydges. Both had the defects
of the antiquarian quality. Rogers, though unamiable, was
probably not unjust when, in acknowledging the likelihood of
Isaac Disraeli’s collections enduring, he described him as “a
man with half an intellect.” In formation and expression of
opinion, Lord Beaconsfield’s father too often wandered from
the silly to the self-evident and back again, like Addison
between his two bottles at the ends of the Holland House
gallery: and his numerous <span lang="fr"><cite>collectanea</cite></span> would certainly be more
useful if they were more accurate. But the <cite>Curiosities</cite>, the
<cite>Amenities</cite>, the <cite>Quarrels</cite>, and all the rest show an ardent love
for literature itself, and a singularly wide knowledge of it:
they are well calculated to inoculate readers, especially young
readers, with both.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.102'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sir Egerton Brydges.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Brydges’s work, less popular, is of a higher quality. His extensive
editing labours were beyond price at his date; in books
like the <span lang="la"><cite>Censura Literaria</cite></span> much knowledge is still readily accessible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>which can only be picked up elsewhere by enormous
excursions of reading at large; and his original critical
power was much higher than is generally allowed.
Such enthusiastic admiration of Shelley as is displayed in
the notes to his Geneva reprint of the English part of Phillips'
<span lang="la"><cite>Theatrum Poetarum</cite></span> in 1824,<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c010'><sup>[542]</sup></a> is not often shown by a man of
sixty-two for a style of poetry entirely different from that
to which he has been accustomed. And it shows, not merely
how true a training the study of older literature is for the
appreciation of newer, but that there must have been something
to train.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.103'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Retrospective Review.</div>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, this first period of enthusiastic exploration did
not merely produce the lectures of Coleridge and Hazlitt,
and the unsurpassed essays of Lamb, the hardly
surpassed ones of Leigh Hunt. It produced also,
by the combined efforts of a band of somewhat
less distinguished persons, a periodical publication of very
considerable bulk and of almost unique value and interest.
It is not for nothing that while old magazines and reviews
are usually sold for less than the cost of their binding, and
not much more than their value as waste-paper, <cite>The Retrospective
Review</cite><a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c010'><sup>[543]</sup></a> still has respectable, though of course not
fantastic, prices affixed to it in the catalogues. It was
started in 1820, under the editorship of Henry Southern,<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c010'><sup>[544]</sup></a>
a diplomatist from the Cantabrigian Trinity, and of the
antiquary afterwards so well known as Sir Harris Nicolas.
Opening with a first volume of extraordinary excellence, it
kept up for seven years and fourteen volumes, on a uniform
principle. The second series, however, which was started
after I know not what breach of continuity,<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c010'><sup>[545]</sup></a> was less fortunate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>and extends to two volumes only, though these contain
much more matter apiece than the earlier ones. It is not
uncommon to find these two volumes, and even some of the first
series, wanting in library sets, which librarians should do their
best to complete; for though, toward the end, the purely
antiquarian matter encroached a very little upon the literary,
there is not a volume from first to last which does not contain
literary matter of the highest interest and value.<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c010'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The proud-looked and high-stomached persons who pronounce
the best in this kind but shadows, and regard old criticism as
being—far more than history in its despised days—“an old
almanack,” will of course look prouder and exalt their stomachs
higher at the use of such terms. So be it. Some day people
will perhaps begin to understand generally what criticism is,
and what is its importance. Then more—as some do already—will
appreciate the interest and the value of this work of
Nicolas, Palgrave, Talfourd, Hartley Coleridge, and other good
men. It would be perfectly easy to make fun of it. The
style may be to modern tastes a little stilted when it is
ambitious, and a little jejune when it is not—in both cases
after the way of the last Georgian standard prose. Although
there is much and real learning, our philologers might doubtless
exalt <em>their</em> stomachs over the neglect of their favourite
study: and the fetichists of biography might discover that
many a Joan is called Jane, and many a March made into
February. These drawbacks and defects are more than compensated
by the general character of the treatment. While
not despising bibliography, the writers as a rule do not put
it first, like Sir Egerton Brydges: nor do they indulge in
the egotistical <span lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span> of “Chandos of Sudeley.” They
have the enormous advantage, in most cases, of coming quite
fresh to their work,—of being able to give a real “squeeze”
direct from the original brass, with the aid of their own appreciation,
unmarred and unmingled by reminiscences of this
essay and that treatise, by the necessity of combating this or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>that authority on their subject. They look at that subject
itself, and even when they show traces of a little prejudice—as
in the opposite cases of the man who is rather hard on
Dryden and the man who is, for the nineteenth century,
astonishingly “soft” on Glover—the impression is obviously
genuine and free from forgery.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is more, these Reviewers give themselves, as a rule,
plenty of room, and supply abundant extracts—things of the
first importance in the case of books, then as a rule to be
found only in the old editions, and in many cases by no means
common now. The scope is wide. The first volume gives,
<span lang="la"><cite>inter alia</cite></span>, articles on Chamberlayne (one for <cite>Pharonnida</cite> and
one for <cite>Love’s Victory</cite>), on Crashaw and Dryden, on Rymer and
Dennis and Heinsius, on Ben Jonson and Cyrano de Bergerac,
on the <cite>Urn Burial</cite>, and on such mere curiosities as <cite>The Voyage
of the Wandering Knight</cite>. The papers throughout on Drama,
from the Mysteries onward, and including separate articles
on the great Elizabethan minors, were, till Pearson’s reprints
thirty years ago, the most accessible source of information
on their subjects, and are still specially notable; as are also
the constituents of another interesting series on Spanish
Literature. The <cite>Arcadia</cite> balances Butler’s <cite>Remains</cite> in vol. ii.
Vaughan and Defoe, <cite>Imitations of Hudibras</cite>, and that luckless
dramatist and mad but true poet, Lee,<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c010'><sup>[547]</sup></a> have their places in
the Third, where also some one (though he came a little too
early to know the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chansons de gestes</cite></span>, and so did not put
“things of Charlemagne” in their right order) has an interesting
article on the Italian compilation <span lang="it"><cite>La Spagna</cite></span>. I
should like to continue this sampling throughout the sixteen
volumes, but space commands only a note on the rest in
detail.<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c010'><sup>[548]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Nor are they afraid of more general discussion. In the
above-mentioned article on John Dennis there is a long passage
which I do not remember to have seen anywhere extracted,
dealing in a singularly temperate and reasonable fashion with
the “off-with-his-head” style of criticism put in fashion by
the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>; and others will be easily found. But they
do not as a rule lay themselves out much for “preceptive”
criticism. It is the <em>other</em> new style of intelligent and well-willing
interpretation to which they incline, and they carry
it out with extraordinary ability and success. To supply those
who may not have time, opportunity, or perhaps even inclination
to read more or less out-of-the way originals with some
intelligible and enjoyable knowledge of them at second-hand;
to prepare, initiate, and guide those who are able and willing
to undertake such reading; to supply those who have actually
gone through it with estimates and judgments for comparison
and appreciation—these may be said to be their three objects.
Some people may, of course, think them trivial objects or unimportant;
to me, I confess, they seem to be objects extremely
well worth attaining, and here very well attained. The papers
in the <cite>Retrospective Review</cite>, be it remembered, anticipated
Sainte-Beuve himself (much more such later English and
American practitioners as Mr Arnold, who was not born, and
Mr Lowell, who was but a yearling when it first appeared) in
the production of the full literary <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>, the applied and
illustrative complement, in regard to individual books, authors,
or small subjects, of the literary history proper. When people
at last begin to appreciate what literary history means, there
will probably be, in every country, a collection of the best
essays of this kind arranged from their authors’ works conveniently
for the use of the student. And when such a
collection is made in England, no small part in it will be
played by articles taken from the <cite>Retrospective Review</cite>.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.104'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Baviad <i>and</i> Anti-Jacobin,</div>

<p class='c001'>For the last subdivision of this chapter we must go a little
backwards. The phenomena of English criticism
in the last decade of the eighteenth century are
curious: and they might be used to support such
very different theories of the relations of Criticism and Creation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>that their most judicious use, perhaps, is to point the moral of
the riskiness of <em>any</em> such theories. During this decade one
great generation was dying off and another even greater was
but coming on. Except Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>, and Burke’s
last and best work (which were both entirely of the past, and
in the former case, at least, presented a purely personal product),
and the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> (which were wholly of the future), with
the shadowy work of Blake (hardly of any time or even any
place), nothing of extraordinary goodness appeared. But a
great deal appeared of a most ordinary and typical badness,
and this seems to have excited a peculiar kind of irregular or
Cossack criticism to carry on a guerilla war against the hosts of
dreary or fantastic dulness. Criticism had at this time little
of a standing army: the old <cite>Critical</cite> and <cite>Monthly</cite> Reviews
were sinking into dotage (though such a man as Southey
wrote in the former), and the new class of comparatively independent
censorship, which put money in its purse and
carried its head high, was to wait for the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> and the
next century. But Hayley and Sir James Bland Burges and
the Della Cruscans; but Darwin even, and even Godwin; nay,
the very early antics of such men as Coleridge and Southey
themselves, with some things in them not so antic perhaps,
but seeming to their contemporaries of an antic disposition—were
more than critical flesh and blood could stand. <a id='sec8.1.105'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>with Wolcot and Mathias.</i></span> The
spirit which had animated Rivarol<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c010'><sup>[549]</sup></a> on the other
side of the Channel came to animate Wolcot (who
had indeed showed it for some time<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c010'><sup>[550]</sup></a>) and his
enemy Gifford, and the greater wits of the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>, and
even the pedantic and prosaic Mathias.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the result of dwelling upon the works of that Pindar
who was born not in Bœotia but in Devonshire, and on the
ever-beloved and delightful <cite>Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite>, if not
also on its prose, would no doubt be far more agreeable to the
reader than much of what he actually finds here: and to dwell
on them would fall in with some of the writer’s oldest and
most cherished tastes. Nay, even the <cite>Baviad</cite> and <cite>Mæviad</cite>, out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of proportion and keeping as is much of their satire, and the
<cite>Pursuits of Literature</cite> itself,—despite its tedious ostentation of
learning, its endless irrelevance of political and other note-divagation,
and its disgusting donnishness without the dignity
of the better don,—give, especially in the three first cases,
much marrowy matter in the texts, and an abundance of the
most exquisite unintentional fooling in the passages cited by
the copious notes. Unfortunately so to dwell would be itself
out of keeping and proportion here. The things<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c010'><sup>[551]</sup></a> are among
the lightest and best examples of the critical <span lang="fr"><i>soufflé</i></span>, well
cheesed and peppered. Or (if the severer muses and their worshippers
disdain a metaphor from Cookery, that Cinderella of
the Fine Arts) let us say that they exemplify most agreeably
the substitution of a sort of critical <span lang="es"><i>banderilla</i></span>, sometimes fatal
enough in its way, for the Thor’s hammer of Dryden and the
stiletto of Pope. But they are only symptoms—we have seen
things of their kind before, from Aristophanes downwards—and
we must merely signal and register them as we pass in this
adventure, keeping and recommending them nevertheless for
quiet and frequent reading <span lang="la"><i>delectationis causa</i></span>. The infallibility
and vitality of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>, in particular, for this
purpose, is something really prodigious. The <cite>Rovers</cite> and the
<cite>New Morality</cite> and the <cite>Loves of the Triangles</cite> seem to lose none
of their virtue during a whole lifetime of the reader, and after
a century of their own existence.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.106'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The influence of the new</i> Reviews, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, one point on which we not only may but
must draw special attention to them. There can be little doubt
that these light velitations of theirs prepared the
way and sharpened the taste for a very considerable
refashioning and new-modelling of the regular
critical-Periodical army which followed so soon.
In this new-modelling some of them—Gifford, Canning, Ellis—were
most important officers, and there can be no doubt at
all that many others transferred, consciously or unconsciously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>this lighter way of criticising from verse to prose, or kept it
up in verse itself such as <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>, which in turn
handed on the pattern to the <cite>Bon Gaultier Ballads</cite> in the
middle, and to much else at the end, of the nineteenth century.
Part of the style was of course itself but a resharpening
of the weapons of the Scriblerus Club; but these weapons
were refurbished brightly, and not a little repointed. The
newer critic was at least supposed to remember that he
was not to be dull.  Unfortunately the personal impertinence
which, though not pretty even in the verse-satirist, is by
a sort of prescription excusable or at least excused in him,
transferred itself to the prose: and the political intolerance
became even greater.<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c010'><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.107'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Jeffrey.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is not the least curious freak of the whirligig of time, as
shown working in this history, that not a century ago one of
the chief places here would have seemed inevitably
due to Francis Jeffrey, while at the present moment
perhaps a large majority of readers would be disposed to grudge
him more than a paragraph, and be somewhat inclined to skip
that.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.108'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His loss of place and its cause.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We cannot “stint his sizings” to that extent. Yet it is also
impossible to give him much space, more particularly because
his interest has shrunk to, and is very unlikely ever
greatly to swell from, that of a kind of representative
position. Jeffrey is no mere English La Harpe,
as some think: he does not exemplify the Neo-classical
“Thorough,” the rigour of the Rule, after the fashion which
makes that remarkable person so interesting. On the contrary,
he is only the last and most noteworthy instance of
that mainly Neo-classic inconsistency which we pointed out
and on which we dwelt in the last volume. Except that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>looks more backward than forward, Jeffrey often reminds us
rather of Marmontel. He has inherited to the fullest extent
the by this time ingrained English belief that canons of
criticism which exclude or depreciate Shakespeare and Milton
“will never do,” as he might have said himself: but he has
not merely inherited, he has expanded and supplemented it.
He has not the least objection to the new school of students
and praisers of those other Elizabethan writers, compared
with whom Shakespeare would have seemed to La Harpe
almost a regular dramatist, and quite a sane and orderly person.
He has a strong admiration for Ford. He will follow a safe
fellow-Whig like Campbell in admiring such an extremely anti-“classical”
thing as Chamberlayne’s <cite>Pharonnida</cite>. He uses
about Dryden and Pope language not very different from Mr
Arnold’s, and he is quite enthusiastic (though of course with
some funny metrical qualms) about Cowper.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.109'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His inconsistency.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But here (except in reference to a man like Keats, who had
been ill-treated by the Tories) he draws the line. There may
have been something political in the attitude which
the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> assumed towards the great new school
of poetry which arose between 1798 and 1820. But politics
cannot have had everything to do with the matter, and it
cannot be an accident that Crabbe is about the only contemporary
poet of mark, except Byron, Campbell, and Rogers, whom
Jeffrey cordially praises. Above all, the reasons of his depreciation
of poets so different as Scott and Wordsworth, and
the things of theirs that he specially blames, are fatal. There
is plenty to be said against Scott as a poet, and plenty to be
said against Wordsworth. <cite>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite> is far
from faultlessly perfect: but the beauty of its subject, its
adaptation of antique matter and manner, and its new versification,
are almost beyond praise from the poetical point of
view. It is exactly these three things that Jeffrey most
blames. There are scores and hundreds of things in Wordsworth
which are helplessly exposed to the critical arrows: but
a man who pronounces the <cite>Daffodils</cite> “stuff” puts himself down
once for all, irrevocably, without hope of pardon or of atonement,
a person insensible to poetry as such, though there may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>be kinds and forms of poetry which, from this or that cause,
he is able to appreciate.<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c010'><sup>[553]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.110'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His criticism on Madame de Staël.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Once more, as in Leigh Hunt’s case (though on the still
smaller scale desirable), we can take a “brick of the house”
with advantage and without absurdity. Indeed I
hardly know anywhere a single Essay which exhibits
a considerable critic so representatively as is done
for Jeffrey by his article on Madame de Staël’s <span lang="fr"><cite>De La Littérature</cite></span>,
which appeared in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> for November 1812 and
stands after the Tractate on Beauty in the forefront of his
Collected Works.<a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c010'><sup>[554]</sup></a> He was in the full maturity of his critical
powers; as a woman (for Jeffrey was quite a chivalrous person),
and as a kind of foreign and female Whig, his author was sure
of favourable treatment; the “philosophic” atmosphere of the
book appealed to his education, nationality, and personal sympathies;
and he had practically most of the knowledge
required.<a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c010'><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And the article is a very good article,—polite in its mild
exposure of Madame de Staël’s hasty generalisations, extremely
clever and capable in its own survey of literature—Jeffrey was
particularly good at these surveys and naturally inclined to
them—sensible, competent, in the highest degree readable.
It would not be easy, unless we took something of Southey’s
on the other side, better to illustrate the immense advance
made by periodical criticism since the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> itself had
shown the way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there are curious drawbacks and limitations which explain
why Jeffrey has not kept, and why he is perhaps not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>very likely to recover, his pride of place. Part of his idiosyncrasy
was a very odd kind of pessimism, which one would
rather have expected from a High Tory than from a “blue and
yellow,” however symbolical these colours may be of fear. To
Jeffrey—in the second decade of the new flourishing of English
poetry, which had at least eighty good years to run; in the very
year of the new birth of the novel; with Goethe still alive
and Heine a boy in Germany; with the best men of the great
French mid-nineteenth century already born—it seems that “the
age of original genius is over.” Now, when a man has once
made up his mind to this, he is not likely to be very tolerant
of attempts on the age’s part to convince him that he is wrong.
But even his judgments of the past exhibit a curious want of
catholicity. The French vein, which is so strong in him, as
well as the general eighteenth-century spirit, which is so much
stronger, appears in a distinct tendency to set Latin above
Greek. He commends the Greeks indeed for their wonderful
“rationality and moderation in imaginative work,” suggesting,
with a mixture of simplicity and shrewdness, that the reason
of this is the absence of any models. Having no originals,
they did not try to be better than these. His criticism of the
two literatures is taken from a very odd angle—or rather from
a maze and web of odd angles. “The fate of the Tarquins,”
he says, “could never have been regarded at Rome as a worthy
occasion either of pity or horror.” And he does not in the
least seem to see—probably he would have indignantly denied—that
in saying this he is denying the Romans any <em>literary</em>
sense at all. In Aristophanes he has nothing to remark but
his “extreme coarseness and vulgarity”; and “the immense
difference between Thucydides and Tacitus” is adjusted to the
advantage of the Roman. He actually seems to prefer Augustan
to Greek poetry, and makes the astonishing remark
that “there is nothing at all in the whole range of Greek
literature like ... the fourth book of Virgil,” having apparently
never so much as heard of Apollonius Rhodius.<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c010'><sup>[556]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>That of mediæval literature he says practically nothing is
not surprising, but it must be taken into account: and his
defence of English Literature against his author, though
perfectly good against <em>her</em>, is necessarily rather limited by its
actual purpose, and suggests somehow that other limitations
would have appeared if it had been freed from this.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.111'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its lesson.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In short, though we cannot support the conclusion further,
the very word “limitation” suggests the name of Jeffrey, in the
sphere of criticism. He seems to be constantly
“pulled up” by some mysterious check-rein, turned
back by some half-invisible obstacle. Sometimes—by no
means quite always—we can concatenate the limiting causes,—deduce
them from something known and anterior, but they
are almost always present or impending. As Leigh Hunt is
the most catholic of critics, so Jeffrey is almost the most
sectarian: the very shibboleths of his sectarianism being
arbitrarily combined, and to a great extent peculiar to himself.<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c010'><sup>[557]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.1.112'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hallam.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Let us conclude the chapter with a figure scarcely less
representative of the anti-enthusiast school of critics, and
much more agreeable than either Gifford or Jeffrey.
To the English student of literary history and of
literary criticism, Henry Hallam must always be a name
<span lang="la"><i>clarum et venerabile</i></span>; nor—as has been so often pointed out in
these pages, and as unfortunately it seems still so often
necessary<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c010'><sup>[558]</sup></a> to point out—need disagreement with a great many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>of his own critical judgments and belief that—for those who
merely swallow such judgments whole—he is not the safest
of critical teachers, interfere with such due homage. <a id='sec8.1.113'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His achievement.</i></span> For
Hallam was our first master in English of the true comparative-historical
study of literature—the study without
which, as one main result of this volume should be
to show, all criticism is now unsatisfactory, and the special
variety of criticism which has been cultivated for the last
century most dangerously delusive. His Introduction to the
<cite>Literature of Europe</cite>, with its sketch of mediæval and its fuller
treatment of Renaissance and seventeenth-century Literature,
is the earliest book of the kind in our language: it is not far
from being, to this day, the best book of the kind in any.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.114'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its merits</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A first attempt of its sort (it cannot be said here with
too much frankness and conviction) can even less than any
other book be faultless: and it is almost a sufficient
proof of Hallam’s greatness that his faults
are not greater. Some things, indeed, that seem to me faults
may not even seem to be so at all to others.  He was aware
that he must “pass over or partially touch” some departments
of at any rate so-called literature; but his preference or rejection
may seem somewhat remarkable. Few will quarrel,
at least from my point of view, with the very large space
given to mere “scholars,” but it is surely strange that a historian
should have thought History of secondary importance,
while according ample space not only to Philosophy and
Theology, but even to Anatomy and Mathematics. A more
serious and a more indisputable blemish is the scanty and
second-hand character of his account of mediæval literature,
which he might almost as well have omitted altogether. It
cannot be too peremptorily laid down that second-hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>accounts of literature are absolutely devoid of any value
whatever:—the best and latest authorities become equally
“not evidence” with the stalest and worst. <a id='sec8.1.115'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>and defects.</i></span> Hallam was
aware of this principle to some extent, and he
almost states it, though of course in his own more
measured way, and with reference to quotation mainly, in his
preface. But his first chapter is really nothing but a tissue
of references to Herder and Eichhorn, Meiners and Fleury,
with original remarks which do not console us. The account
of Boethius at the very beginning is a pretty piece of rhetoric,
but, as the Germans would say, not in the least “ingoing.”
It is a horrible heresy to say<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c010'><sup>[559]</sup></a> that “It is sufficient to look
at any extracts” from the Dark Ages “to see the justice
of this censure,” for no collection of extracts will justify the
<em>formation</em> of any critical opinion whatsoever, though it may
support, or at least illustrate, one formed from reading whole
works.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.116'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>In general distribution and treatment.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Further, in a note of Hallam’s<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c010'><sup>[560]</sup></a> I think may be found the
origin of Mr Arnold’s too exclusive preference for “the best
and principal” things and his disparagement of the
historic estimate, though I trust that Mr Arnold<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c010'><sup>[561]</sup></a>
would not have shared Hallam’s contempt, equally
superfine and superficial, for the “barbarous Latin”
of the Dark Ages. Finally, it is difficult to conceive a more
inadequate reference to one of the most epoch-making of
European poems (which is at the same time in its earlier part
one of not the least charming) than the words “A very celebrated
poem, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman de la Rose</cite></span>, had introduced an unfortunate
taste for allegory in verse, from which France did
not extricate herself for several generations.” It is all the
worse because nothing in it is positively untrue.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be said to be unjust to dwell on what is avowedly
a mere overture: but unluckily, when Hallam comes to his
subject proper, all trace of second-hand treatment does not
disappear. The part played by direct examination becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>very much larger; and the writer’s reading is a matter of
just admiration, nor does he ever for one moment pretend to
have read what he has not. But he has no scruple in supplementing
his reading at second-hand, or even in doubling
his own frequently excellent judgments with long quoted
passages from writers like Bouterwek. Further, the surprise
which has been hinted above as to his admissions and exclusions,
and at his relative admissions in point of departments,
may perhaps after a time change into a disappointed
conviction that his first interest did not lie in literature, as
literature, at all; but in politics <a id='corr296.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eccesiastical'>ecclesiastical</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_296.11'><ins class='correction' title='eccesiastical'>ecclesiastical</ins></a></span> and civil, juristics,
moral and other philosophy, and the like. I am inclined to
think that Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, and Grotius have, between
them, more space than is devoted to all Hallam’s figures
in <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> from Rabelais to Dryden.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.117'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>In some particular instances.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I could support this with a very large number of <span lang="fr"><i>pièces</i></span> if it
were necessary; but a few must suffice, and in those few we
shall find a further count against Hallam arising.
Note, for instance, his indorsement of Meiners'
complaint that Politian “did not scruple to take
words from such writers as Apuleius and Tertullian,” an
indorsement which in principle runs to the full folly of
Ciceronianism, and with which it is well to couple and perpend
the round assertion elsewhere that Italian is—even it would
seem for Italians—an inferior literary instrument to Latin.
Secondly, take the astounding suggestion that the <span lang="la"><cite>Epistolæ
Obscurorum Virorum</cite></span> “surely” have “not much intrinsic
merit,” and the apparent dismissal of them as “a mass of
vapid nonsense and bad grammar.” As if the very vapidity of
the nonsense did not give the savour, and the badness of the
grammar were not the charm! Here again another judgment
(on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Satire Menippée</cite></span>) clinches the inference that Hallam’s
taste for humour was small. If he is not uncomplimentary,
he is strikingly inadequate, on Marot: and in regard to the
Pléiade he simply follows the French to do evil, and as elsewhere
puts himself under the guidance of—La Harpe! Few
“heroic enthusiasts” will read his longer and more appreciative
notice of Spenser without perceiving “some want, some coldness”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>in it; fewer will even expect not to find these privations
in that of Donne. But the shortest of his shortcomings are
reached in his article on Browne, and in part of that on
Shakespeare. In the latter the famous sentence on the Sonnets
is not, I think, so unforgivable as the slander on Juliet;<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c010'><sup>[562]</sup></a> in
the former one can simply quote in silence of comment. “His
style is not flowing, but vigorous; his choice of words not
elegant, and even approaching to barbarism in English phrase:
yet there is an impressiveness, an air of reflection and serenity,
in Browne’s writings which redeem many of his faults.”<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c010'><sup>[563]</sup></a> The
sentence that “<span lang="fr"><cite>Gondibert</cite></span> is better worth reading than <cite>The
Purple Island</cite>, though it may have less of that which distinguishes
a poet from another man”—in other words, that an
unpoetical poem is better worth reading than a poetical one—is
sufficiently tell-tale. It is not surprising, after it, that Hallam
speaks respectfully of Rymer—a point where Macaulay, so
often his disciple, fortunately left him.</p>

<a id='sec8.1.118'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His central weakness,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Something, it has been said, will inevitably emerge from
these utterances on a tolerably intelligent consideration.
Hallam has abundant erudition, much judicial quality,
a shrewdness which generally guides him more
or less right in points of fact; sense; fairness; freedom from
caprice—even (except as regards the Middle Ages, and especially
mediæval Latin and its ancestors back to the late Silver Age)
a certain power of regarding literature impartially. But he
has, as is so often done (he alludes to the fact himself somewhere),
spoken his own doom in words which he applies (with
remarkable injustice as it happens) to Fontenelle. He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“cool good sense, and an incapacity, by natural privation, of
feeling the highest excellence in works of taste.”</p>

<a id='sec8.1.119'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and the value left by it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In short, “The Act of God”: and for such acts it is as
unreasonable as it is indecent to blame their victims. But at
the same time we may carry our forbearance to
natural privations too far by accepting blind men
as guides in precipitous countries, or using as a
bloodhound a dog who has no scent. And therefore it is
impossible to assign to Hallam a high place as a critic. He
may be—he is—useful even in this respect as a check and
a reminder of the views which once were taken by men of
wide information, excellent discipline, literary disposition, and
(where it was not seared or paralysed) positive taste; but he
will not soon recover any other value. Even thus he is to
a critic that always critically estimable thing a <span lang="fr"><cite>point de repère</cite></span>,
and in the kindred but not identical function of literary
historian, the praise which was given to him at the opening of
this notice may be maintained in spite of, and not inconsistently
with, anything that has been said meanwhile.<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c010'><sup>[564]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nay, more, Specialism has made such inroads upon us—has
bondaged the land to such hordes of robber-barons—that we
may not soon expect again, and may even regard with a tender
<span lang="la"><i>desiderium</i></span>, the width, the justice, the far-reaching and self-sufficing

this chapter was first written, as a salute

not an “impartial observer” at all.
And I have generally found that the
best of such observers, even if they do
not agree with me, are disposed to
admit that W. W. said more than
he meant, and even to some extent
what he did <em>not</em> mean.</p>

critical phrases of the world, “to produce
that  willing <i>suspension of disbelief
for the moment</i> which constitutes
poetic faith.” It derives of course
from  Aristotle, but the advance  on
the original is immense.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f357'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r357'>357</a>. “And from all other species having
this object in common with it, it is
discriminated by proposing to itself
such delight from the whole as is
compatible with a distinct gratification
from each component part.” This
is the dialect of “Cimmerian Lodge”
with a vengeance! An attempt to
expound it will be found in the
abstract of the <em>Lectures</em> of 1811 given
by J. P. Collier: but it sheds little
light. And simpler Estesian definitions
elsewhere—“Prose is words in
good order: poetry the best words in
the best order,” &#38;c.—labour likewise
under the common curse that <em>Poetry</em>
escapes them. What better words in
what better order than the Lord’s
Prayer? Is that poetry?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f358'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r358'>358</a>. The extraordinary critical genius
of Coleridge can hardly be better shown
than by his gloss here on the Petronian
enigma, <span lang="la"><i>Præcipitandus est liber spiritus</i></span>,
to which we have referred so often.
The poet—the image is not Coleridge’s,
but I think it very fairly illustrates
his view—<em>rides</em> the reader’s own genius,
and both together attain the goal.</p>

haphazard, garbling, caricature
in selection of instances, are the chief
faults that Coleridge finds with both
<cite>Edinburgh</cite> and <cite>Quarterly</cite>. The reply
is dignified in tone and not unjust; but,
like other things of the same kind, it
illustrates certain permanent weaknesses
of human nature.  All the
faults, I think, which Coleridge finds
with “Blue and Yellow” and “Buff”
reviewing might be found with his own
critique of Maturin’s <cite>Bertram</cite>, printed
in this very volume. All these faults
certainly found by every generation
of authors with their critics, even
when these authors happen to have
been copious and constant writers of
criticism themselves. Always is the
author tempted, like Mr Baxter, to
cry, “Ah, but <em>I</em> was in the right, and
these men are dreadfully in the
wrong”; always does he think, like
the Archbishop of Granada, that the
incriminated part of his sermon is exactly
the best part; always, when he
bewails the absence of the just and impartial
critics of other times, does he
forget the wise ejaculation of Mr Rigmarole,
“Pretty much like our own, I
fancy!”  (There is no mental reservation
in these remarks.)</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f369'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r369'>369</a>. “Concluding” in strictness they
are not; for Coleridge, in one of his

of <span lang="la"><i>coda</i></span> to the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span>, tipped it

<p class='c001'><a href='#r371'>371</a>. An agreeable American critic, Miss

Coleridge must have been “a very

<p class='c001'><a href='#r373'>373</a>. Mr Dykes Campbell (whose threading
of the maze and piecing of the

marvel) thought, or seemed to think,
that the Introduction grew into the
<cite>Biographia</cite> itself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f374'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r374'>374</a>. <cite>Satyrane’s Letters</cite> themselves contain
a good deal of criticism in and out
of the interview with Klopstock (p.
270 <i>sq.</i>, ed. cit.), where the credit is
claimed by some for Wordsworth.
The <cite>Critique on Bertram</cite> opens well
on the “Don Juan” story, but the
rest of it is not <span lang="es"><i>muy hermosa cosa</i></span>,
combining, as it does, that snarling
and carping tone, against which Coleridge
is always and justly protesting,
with more than a suspicion of personal
spite. For <cite>Bertram</cite> had been preferred
to <cite>Zapolya</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f375'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r375'>375</a>. The usually known reprint of the
2nd ed. of 1818 is very different from
the original, published in the extraordinary
fashion described by Coleridge
himself in the <cite>Biographia</cite>, during
1809-10, and collected in volume form
thereafter. This latter is perhaps the
better worth reading. It is at any rate
a confirmation of the at first sight
immoral maxim that you should always
buy a book you want, whether you can
afford it or not. Twenty years ago it
was not common but comparatively
cheap; now, alas! it is both uncommon
and very dear.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f376'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r376'>376</a>. The editor of these, the late Mr
Thomas Ashe (author of a poem far too
little read—<cite>The Sorrows of Hypsipyle</cite>),
took much pains with them; and if he
could have kept back a few flings,
would have deserved unqualified
thanks. “Never mind God’s will”
may be noble counsel, or an unlucky
advice to run worse than your head
against worse than a stone wall. But
it is certainly out of place in very brief
and rare notes on a classical author.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f377'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r377'>377</a>. The question—a puzzle like other
<span lang="la"><cite>Quæstiones Estesianæ</cite></span>—about the exact
numbers and dates of Coleridge’s
Shakespearian courses is not for us.
It is enough to say that our extant
materials (consisting, in regard to some
lectures, of notes and reports from
several different sources) chiefly, if not
wholly, concern two courses delivered in
London (1811-12 and 1818), and one at
Bristol, 1813-14. Of the Royal Institution
Lectures of 1806-7, on which he
relied (throwing them even farther
back) to prove his priority to Schlegel,
nothing at all, unluckily, is preserved.
Indeed Mr Dykes Campbell insisted,
and seems to have almost proved, that
none at all were delivered till Jan. 1808.
And of these we have only Crabb
Robinson’s brief references.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f378'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r378'>378</a>. This perhaps should, and can very
shortly, be demonstrated:—Observation
may be either broad and sweeping, or
minute and concentrated; Johnson
specifies the former kind in the last
half of the first line. Observation may
be directed to men, to things, &#38;c.;
it is to mankind that he wishes it
directed, and he says so in the first
half of the second. Further, as this
is too abstract, he gives the poetic
and imaginative touch by filling in
the waste atlas, with “China” and
“Peru,” with the porcelain and the
pigtails, the llamas and the gold associated
with mankind in these countries.
And in the name of Logic, and Rhetoric
and Poetry into the bargain, “What for
no?”</p>

press must almost necessarily repeat
themselves, and Hazlitt (whose work
often comes to us directly from the
press itself) is not so very much less
peccant in this kind than Coleridge.
Coleridge’s own method exposes the
peccadillo ruthlessly. The “Let Observation”
criticism occurs several
times: the story about the Falls of
Lanark and the man who, beginning
with “majestic,” spoilt it by “very
pretty,” over and over again. Nor is
this repetition merely due to the
chaotic state of his publications; it
seems to have been a congenital bias,
as testified to in his conversation quite
early.</p>

the nearest expression of it, the  “la

Lamb praised him, though the former

be best placed, in the note which is as
much as he deserves, that much-written-of
“curiosity of  literature,”
the poisoner, connoisseur, and coxcomb,
Wainewright.  “Janus,” however, was
too much occupied with pictures, plays,
bric-à-brac, Montepulciano, veal-pies in
red earthenware dishes, the prize-ring,
and other fancies or fopperies, to busy
himself directly with literature, save,
perhaps, in the curious paper “Janus
Weatherbound,” which seems to have
been <em>his</em> “farewell to essay-writing.”
It is, however, fair to say that, odious
as he was in ways not merely moral,
he had something of “a taste” here
also.  His quotations, which are numerous,
are singularly well selected; he
admired not merely Fouqué but
Shelley long before it was the fashion
to do so; and you may pick out of
the works, rather probably than certainly
his (<cite>Essays and Criticisms</cite>, by

that I place Shelley’s great poetical twin
(or rather tally) in a note only here.
I have already more than once referred

but very vigorous and remarkable
verse-formulation of the protest against
Neo-classicism; the two prefaces
(especially the final one) to <cite>Endymion</cite>
have been generally recognised by the
competent as perhaps the most
astonishingly just judgments which
any poet has ever passed on himself:
and the <cite>Letters</cite> are full of critical or
quasi-critical passages of the highest
interest. I myself have a sheaf of
them duly noted; and some persons
of distinction whom I know would
admit them to the very Golden Book
of Criticism. I hope, however, that
my own judgment is not too much
sicklied o’er with crotchet in holding
that Keats’s criticism of himself and
others is somewhat too spontaneous
and automatic, somewhat too much of
a mere other phase of his creation, to
deserve the name of criticism properly
so-called. He speaks of Shakespeare
admirably, because he has the same
quintessentially English cast of poetry
that Shakespeare had. When he
speaks of poetry in the abstract, as he
does admirably and often, it is this
poetry speaking of herself, and therefore
speaking truly but not critically.
Even in the wonderful remark (vol. v.
p. 111., ed. Forman, Glasgow, 1901) on
himself and Byron, “He describes
what he sees: I describe what I imagine”
(where he repeats Philostratus
without in the least knowing it), the
thing is not criticism: it is self-speaking.
And beyond this he seldom
goes, and is seldomer happy in his
rare excursions. He might have become
a critic, as he might have become
almost anything good; but I do not
think he was one.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f552'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r552'>552</a>. I do not think it necessary to give
Gifford’s prose or periodical criticism
a separate place. It is by no means
easily separable as such; and if separated
I fancy there would be very little
to say for it, and that what would
have to be said against it is better
summed up in the words of no less
a political sympathiser and personal
friend than Scott. A “cankered
carle” cannot be a good critic, any
more than a mildewed grape can give
good wine. But Gifford was not quite
so bad as he has seemed to some; and
his editorial work, especially on Jonson,
deserves almost the highest praise.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f553'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r553'>553</a>. I know, of course, that even Coleridge
spoke unadvisedly about these
immortal flowers. But he had got a
“philosophical” craze at the moment:
and he did not call them “stuff.”</p>

itself requires very little notice. It
is an ingenious variation upon Alison,
whose book it reviews, praises, and
supports, with some unfairness to
Gerard. But it abstains, almost
comically and not uninstructively to
an impartial thinker on æsthetics,
from any definite literary applications.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r555'>555</a>. He makes indeed an awkward slip
by linking Machiavel as a contemporary
with Shakespeare, Bacon, Montaigne,

if even recently, that literary history
has been carefully attended to, and
Coleridge himself makes slips quite as
bad.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r556'>556</a>. How much of this was got from
his author herself I leave to others
to decide. A comparison with what

about Jeffrey as a critic may be found

worth examining are, besides the
“Staël,” “Cowper,” “Ford,” “Keats,”
and “Campbell’s <cite>Specimens</cite>,” those on
<cite>W. Meister</cite> (very curious and interesting),
Richardson, Scott, and Byron
(very numerous and full of piquancies),
Crabbe, Wordsworth of course (though
with as much wisdom as good feeling
he kept much of the most offensive
matter both on Wordsworth and
Southey out), and Burns. In regard
to the latter I cannot help thinking
that he played the <span lang="la"><cite>Advocatus Diaboli</cite></span>
better than either Mr Arnold, Mr
Shairp, or my late friend Mr Henley.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f558'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r558'>558</a>. The popularity, in late years, of
the singularly uncritical words “sympathetic”
and “unsympathetic” in
describing Criticism, would of itself
point to this necessity. It would
seem impossible for a large number
of persons to “like” otherwise than
“grossly” in Dryden’s sense, or to
imagine that any one else can like
delicately, with discrimination, in the
old sense “nicely.” A “sympathetic”
notice or criticism is one which pours
unmixed cataracts of what the cooks
call oiled butter all over the patient:
a notice that questions this part of
him, rejects that, but gives due value
to the gold and the silver and the
precious stones, while discarding the
hay and the stubble, is “unsympathetic.”
Many years (many lustres
even, alas!) ago, an old friend and
colleague of mine, since distinguished
in his own country as a critic, M.
Paul Stapfer, complained that Englishmen,
and still more Englishwomen,
had only two critical categories—the
“dry” and the “pretty.” These were
unsatisfactory enough, but I think they
were better than “sympathetic” and
“unsympathetic” as now often used.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r563'>563</a>. We could abandon Owen Felltham
to him with more equanimity if he did
not describe, as “vile English, or
properly no English,” such words as
“nested,” “parallel” as a verb, and
“uncurtain,” all excellent English of
the best brand and vintage, formed
on the strictest and most idiomatic
patents of analogy. There is still far
too much criticastry and pedanticulism
(here’s for them!) of this kind about,
and men like Hallam are very mainly
responsible for it. Even “obnubilate,”
to which he also objects, is a perfectly
good word, on all-fours with “compensate,”
which he himself uses in the same
context, though less usual. A sovereign
of just weight, fineness, and stamp
is none the worse for having been little
circulated: nor is a word.</p>

<p class='c025'>It is well known, even to not very careful students of French
literature, that the famous term which has been taken as the
title of this chapter is something of a misnomer,—that
the still more famous “representation of
<span lang="fr"><cite>Hernani</cite></span>” was in effect the shouting after the battle, not the
battle itself.  The pains which have been spent above on the
Empire Critics, greater and smaller, must have been most
ill-bestowed if they have not shown that the working of the
world-spirit had done already much of what had to be done—that
the <em>i</em>'s only had to be dotted and the <em>t</em>'s crossed, by
the end of the third decade of the nineteenth century.  The
crossing and dotting was done, as usual, with some violence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and it attracted corresponding attention; but the letters had
been shaped long before. Dubois and Pierre Leroux had
founded the famous <i>Globe</i>—object of the admiration of Goethe
and cradle of the talent of Sainte-Beuve and others—in 1824.
It furnishes comfort and support to those who believe that
criticism is nothing if not philosophical, by the very strong
philosophical colour which it took on. Jouffroy was one of
its chief pillars; and attention has often been drawn to his
tractate in it, <span lang="fr"><i>Comment les dogmes finissent</i></span> (as to which it
can only be remarked that no dogma has ever died yet, and
that every dogma, as a natural product of something in human
nature, is immortal till human nature perishes), as a symptom
and symbol of its literary as of its other doctrines. <a id='sec8.2.2'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Charles de Rémusat, Vitet, J. J. Ampère.</i></span> We are
here, however, only concerned with its strictly (if not merely)
literary contributors, Sainte-Beuve himself, Charles
de Rémusat, J. J. Ampère, Vitet, and the rest. Of
Sainte-Beuve we shall have plenty to say presently;
the rest need not delay us long. The extraordinarily
brilliant talents of Charles de Rémusat<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c010'><sup>[565]</sup></a> were always
touching literature: but philosophy and politics constantly
drew him away from the Muses proper, though whether he
talks of Abelard or of Anselm, of Bacon or of Channing,
he is never negligible. Vitet became a politician and an
antiquary chiefly, but has left at least one remarkable literary
document in his well-known essay on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chanson de Roland</cite></span>.<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c010'><sup>[566]</sup></a>
As for J. J. Ampère, he supplemented and furthered the study
of foreign literatures, which Villemain had made almost
obligatory, by an unusual frequentation of foreign countries;
and besides some excellent work on the literary history
(especially in mediæval times) of his own language, wrote
many books of literary travel.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>On the whole, however (for Sainte-Beuve grew out of and
far above his <cite>Globe</cite> stage), the <em>general</em> interest of the reviewing
in this paper is superior to that of its component parts as
criticisms and its individual authors as critics. Those who
now read Goethe’s remarks on it to Eckermann<a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c010'><sup>[567]</sup></a> may, if they
neglect the historic estimate, be a little puzzled at the great
German’s enthusiasm. He was right, however, as, in a general
way, he usually was. These young men took literature with
a wider knowledge and purview of it than the old critics had
brought to bear, and with very much less subservience to
particular theory as to what the book <em>ought to be</em>, and a more
obliging though quite independent attention to what it <em>was</em>.
Their “eclecticism” (which was philosophically the tone or ticket
of their paper) adapted itself especially well to these literary
exercitations: indeed Eclecticism is never so well justified of
any of her necessarily mixed family as in literature. But
their greatest is their greatest by so far, that we may well
turn to him.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sainte-Beuve: his topography.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Sainte-Beuve was not infrequently seized with an amiable
and very convenient fancy for constructing small retrospective
guides and clues to the mighty maze of his fifty or
sixty volumes of critical essays. The most definite
and important, written in September 1861, just at
the beginning of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux Lundis</cite></span>, and appended to the
second volume of the Garnier edition of <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span>,
distributes his whole career under heads. First comes his
novitiate in the <cite>Globe</cite> up to 1827; then the Romantic campaign
of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Ronsard</cite></span>, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Tableau du Seizième Siècle</cite></span>, and the articles
of 1828-29; then the nearly twenty years’ stretch of his contributions
(preserved in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span> themselves
and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span>) to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite></span>,
with <span lang="fr"><cite>Port-Royal</cite></span> as a solid cut-and-come-again accompaniment;
then <span lang="fr"><cite>Chateaubriand et son Groupe</cite></span>; then the <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries du Lundi</cite></span>
properly so called, and, lastly, the series which he was beginning
as he wrote. The work of the first period of which he speaks
with some disdain—<span lang="fr"><i>ce ne sont que des essais sans importance</i></span>—he
never actually republished; but towards the end of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>life he repented and intended to do so, and such part of it
as could be recovered appeared posthumously, with a good
many waifs and strays of other kinds, as <span lang="fr"><cite>Premiers Lundis</cite></span>. If
to these we add the <span lang="fr"><cite>Étude sur Virgile</cite></span><a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c010'><sup>[568]</sup></a> and perhaps the
<span lang="fr"><cite>P. J. Proudhon</cite></span>,<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c010'><sup>[569]</sup></a> we shall nearly have exhausted his available
stores, and quite, I think, those of critical interest.<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c010'><sup>[570]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The earlier articles.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The earliest detachment of this great army, as presented
in that <span lang="fr"><i>régiment de marche</i></span> the <span lang="fr"><cite>Premiers Lundis</cite></span> (made up of
all sort of things from these raw recruits to the
poor old veterans of Senate-speech more than forty
years later), might deserve their author’s modest or merciless
sentence from the severe point of view of his greatest pupil.
They are certainly not “chief and principal things” in themselves.
Sainte-Beuve was very young (barely twenty) when
he began to write them, and, as we have said, it is nearly
impossible for a very young critic to be a very good critic,
though it is deplorably possible for a rather old one to be
more than rather bad. Some of them are so short as to give
no room for much display of individual and original talent.
Sometimes they deal with things ephemeral, and now forgotten,
in a merely journalist fashion. Sometimes, as in the dealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>with Scott’s <cite>Napoleon</cite>, inevitable and insuperable prejudices
and preoccupations come in. One may even admit frankly
that, <span lang="la"><i>nonnunquam</i></span>, there are symptoms which lead one to
understand, after a fashion, the charges of dulness<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c010'><sup>[571]</sup></a> and of
<span lang="fr"><i>galimatias</i></span> which were brought against Sainte-Beuve by persons
from Balzac<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c010'><sup>[572]</sup></a> downwards, and which have sometimes seemed
mere spiteful lunacy to readers of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries</cite></span> at their most
brilliant period only. But to the expert there is unmistakable
and not merely fancied <em>quality</em> even here. There is already
the indefinable, but in previous critics so unfortunately rare,
desire to appreciate, to understand. There is almost always
a sober judgment; not seldom a delicate if rather tentative
subtlety. Above all, there are signs of something very different
from the sham omniscience which is such a temptation to
the young reviewer,—of a range and width of reading, classical,
modern, foreign, most surprising and most unusual at the
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Tableau</cite></span>,<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c010'><sup>[573]</sup></a> with its associated selection of Ronsard, and
some other matter appended to its later editions, is quite a
landmark in French literary history. It turned (or rather
marked the turning of) the tide in regard to sixteenth-century
literature, interested the youth of the day in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>,
stimulated the new prosodical movements, did much else.
But its author’s powers were immature: and there is not a
great deal of the highest critical importance in its individual
utterances and judgments. Perhaps the most noteworthy is
the statement in the <cite>Preface</cite> that “L’Art consacre et purifie
tout ce qu’il touche”—a companion axiom to the Preface of
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Orientales</cite></span>, which neither critic nor poet would have fully
indorsed in their later days, though many of their followers
would.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><span lang="fr">Portraits Littéraires</span> <i>and</i> <span lang="fr">Portraits de Femmes</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span>, with its satellite or tow-boat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span><span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits de Femmes</cite></span>, appears to have been a sort of favourite
with Sainte-Beuve. He rearranged it early from
the original <span lang="fr"><cite>Critiques et Portraits Littéraires</cite></span>;<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c010'><sup>[574]</sup></a> he
sifted out the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits de Femmes</cite></span>, as if to concentrate
special attention on them; he added from
time to time appetising and really important bonuses and
<em>primes</em> of appendices, <span lang="fr"><cite>Pensées</cite></span>, personal confidences, and the
like. A good deal of his best-known work is in the four
volumes (including the <span lang="fr"><cite>Femmes</cite></span>) as they are now<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c010'><sup>[575]</sup></a> current:
and probably the collection meets the taste, of the general
reader at least, as well as any other of his numerous collections,
if not better. This, I venture to think,—using a phrase
of an author who would probably not have agreed with me
in this particular instance,—is because the general reader “does
not want criticism,” or does not want it first of all. Sainte-Beuve,
who knew everything, and cared not to conceal it, knew,
as the general reader does not know, that the <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>, whether
in volume- or essay-form, of mingled biography and criticism,
was of English, not French invention: and he confesses that
he longed to imitate it. He did so, and carried it even
beyond Johnson: but he was frequently tempted to let the
biography and the personality rather swamp the criticism,
and I think he has done so here. In the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits de Femmes</cite></span>
especially, be it gallantry, gossip-loving, or God knows what,
though there may be much interest, there is uncommonly
little criticism, even on La Rochefoucauld, who presents himself
in the middle of the galaxy with a singular and sultanesque
intrusion. On some of the subjects, such as Mme. de Longueville,
there could be none: even on Mme. de Sévigné and
Mme. de Staël, where the opportunities were infinite, there
is little; and where there is most, as in the case of Pauline de
Meulan (Mme. Guizot), it is where we care least about it.
Of history and life plenty, and therefore of amusement much;
of criticism very little.</p>

<p class='c001'>Life and its farrago—of which I desire not to speak disrespectfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>more than of any other equator, but which are
not my subject—have rather less exclusive hold in the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span> proper and segregated, but still a greater
hold than literature. In those days Sainte-Beuve, as he himself
more than once confesses, was even more of a philosopher
than of a <span lang="fr"><i>littérateur</i></span>. There are of course exceptions, where
the past greatness of the author takes the future greatness
of the critic by storm beforehand, and forces acquaintance
and recognition from its destined brother. Even in these
cases one often feels that the critic “is not ready”—that the
hour has not fully come. The early and strongly “Romantic”
articles on the great classics of the seventeenth century, which
open the first volume, are not merely wrong with the crudity
of early partisanship, as he himself represents them. Indeed
in this respect they are hardly wrong at all. But they are
not right in the right way. Except the very remarkable
piece, “Du Génie Critique et de Bayle,” where the vocation
asserted itself, there is hardly one of them (if even this is)
worthy of Sainte-Beuve. The “Diderot,” to make a move
forward, is capital on the man, a little short of capital on
the writer. The best critical thing in the volume is the
“Nodier”—much later in date (1840) than the rest of its contents.
The second volume, which has something of this advantage,
in point of time, contains much better things:—the well-known
“Molière,” the long (some would say the disproportionately
long) “Fontanes,” the “Joseph de Maistre,”<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c010'><sup>[576]</sup></a> the
“Naudé,” and a delightful paper on Aloysius Bertrand of
<span lang="fr"><cite>Gaspard de la Nuit</cite></span>,<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c010'><sup>[577]</sup></a> which combines the old Romantic enthusiasm
with the acquired craftsmanship. The third, better
still in this latter respect, has less interesting subjects, except in
the case of the “Theocritus” and the “Mlle. Aissé,” which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>again a <span lang="fr">“Portrait de Femme,”</span> hardly at all literary. A
sacred shame invades me at even appearing to speak disrespectfully
of this book. Compared with anything not of
its author’s, and not of that author’s at a future time, it
would be very great: but its greater younger brothers are its
enemies.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.6'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Portraits Contemporains.</div>

<p class='c001'>Still not of these is the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span>. One feels
inclined to say at the beginning, and perhaps not disinclined
to repeat the saying at the end, that the title announces
an attempt foredoomed to failure.<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c010'><sup>[578]</sup></a> It is
almost inevitable that a contemporary portrait in
literature should fail to be a likeness, should be at best a
<em>charge</em>, from one point of view or another. Sainte-Beuve
himself in one place (with a naïveté more characteristic of him
than those who have not read him very long and very carefully
may think, but seldom so openly expressed) admits that his
sitters had an awkward trick of falsifying his presentations.
He had traced out for them, more or less early in their career,
that career as they <em>ought</em> to pursue it; but lo! they would
follow their own stars, and not his tracings and indications.
This is one danger, and a common, if not universal one, with
its result,—not often realised in Sainte-Beuve’s own case, but
constantly in that of smaller critics,—that the prophet loses his
temper with these disobedient ducklings, and rates them, not
because they behave badly, but because they behave in a
way different from that which he expected and wished. But
more dangerous still, and less to be avoided even by the
staunchest and most vigilant censors, are those insidious, innumerable,
ineluctable personal or partisan differences and
prejudices which dazzle and trouble the contemporary’s eyes:
and, worst perhaps of all, that incurable “too-nearness,” that
hopeless lack of the firm perspective of the past, which clings
to him, and will not let him attain to clearness and the
Whole.  Accordingly the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span> are, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span>, the most unequal of Sainte-Beuve’s
work, and all the more often disappointing because of the
contemporaneity.</p>

<p class='c001'>That reserve, indeed, which was made at the end of the
notice of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span> is even more imperatively
called for here, and it is most important that while recognising
that the real Sainte-Beuve—the plenilune—is as yet but
crescent, we should recognise his brightness and his crescency.
It is, for instance, not merely hasty, but fundamentally uncritical,
to exclaim at the length, the fulness, the cordiality,
with which figures like Fontanes, Fauriel, Daunou are treated;
and to contrast, with abomination, the hesitancy, the grudging,
the reserves, in the case not merely of Hugo,<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c010'><sup>[579]</sup></a> but of Vigny,
Lamartine, even Musset, the roughness on Balzac, the comparative
respect paid to Sue, and the comparatively cavalier
treatment long accorded to Gautier. Even in regard to the
great stone of stumbling, it is necessary, for us who were born
later, to remember that however ardent in the <span lang="fr"><i>chevelu</i></span> and
<span lang="fr"><i>gilet rouge</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>hierro!</i></span> manner we may think we should have
been if we had been born earlier, the Hugo of the time before
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Châtiments</cite></span>, and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Contemplations</cite></span>, and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Legénde</cite></span>, great
as he is, is not the Hugo of that glorious trinity. As for the
Empire Critics, no impatience at their disproportionate allowance
ought to prevent acknowledgment of Sainte-Beuve’s rare
equity and true critical spirit towards the immediate predecessors
with whom he did <em>not</em> agree—a thing, as we have
seen, deplorably rare in criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, save in that Supreme Court of Critical History
where the dignity of the place excuses the personal insignificance
of the judge, and puts the greatest author on his defence,
apology for these five volumes would be needless, and almost
impertinent. They certainly need not fear assay either of
pieces or of passages. In the First, where most of the dubious
places occur, where the judgment is most immature, and the</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>style most inclined to the jargonish,<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c010'><sup>[580]</sup></a> the “Senancour,” and in
part the “Lamennais,” demand special notice, while the opening
of the “Béranger,” with its sketch of the <span lang="fr"><cite>causerie</cite></span> method, is
of extreme interest, and the frequent references to English
writers<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c010'><sup>[581]</sup></a> show us already the largeness of the critic’s equipment.
The Second is perhaps to be more cordially welcomed
for the miscellanies at its end (including the striking critical
imaginations put into the mouths of Diderot and Hazlitt) than
for any of its more imposing constituents. The “Balzac”
article, though it is in the main just, has a harshness and a
touch of personal rudeness about it which are very unusual
in Sainte-Beuve, and not quite explicable. The novelist might
certainly be excused for thinking it wantonly uncivil. It is
a little distressing, too, to read the hostile appendix which
Sainte-Beuve ill-advisedly put to his “Montalembert” paper.
But “<span lang="fr"><i>Misères que tout cela!</i></span>” The “Ballenche” and the
“Villemain,” the “Mme. Desbordes-Valmore” and the <span lang="de">“Ulric
Guttinguer,”</span><a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c010'><sup>[582]</sup></a> nearly, if not quite, take the taste out. In
vol. iii., an extremely interesting opening on Vinet, and a
good close on Mérimée, hold between them things even better
and sometimes well known—the <span lang="de">“Töpffer,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“Xavier de
<a id='err308.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='errata' title='Maistre'>Mestre</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#e_308.8'><ins class='correction' title='Maistre'>Mestre</ins></a></span>,”</span> the “Jasmin,” the “J. J. Ampère”—and show, in
the “Magnin” and elsewhere, that admirably <em>horizontal</em> view
of all periods of French literature which Sainte-Beuve was
almost the first to take, and in which he has had far too few
followers, whether in regard to French literature or others.</p>

<p class='c001'>This reappears in the “Fauriel,”<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c010'><sup>[583]</sup></a> which takes up nearly a
third of vol. iv., and is there accompanied by an excellent
paper on Barante, a longer but much less capital one on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Thiers, two of Sainte-Beuve’s best known pieces on Leopardi
and Parny, and one—for us—of peculiar interest on Daunou,
containing perhaps the most vivid, and at the same time
delicate, sketch in existence of the latest type of Neo-classic
critic in France, before M. Brunetière’s revival sixty years
later,—a type without La Harpe’s exaggeration and caricature,
with a certain mildness and toleration towards the
newer things, but secretly and <em>saturatedly</em> convinced that
Reason is the Goddess of Literature, that fine verse <em>is</em> “almost
as good as fine prose,” and that fineness in both consists of
absolute good sense, logical connection, grammatical impeccability,
and a horror of the <span lang="la"><i>verbum inusitatum</i></span>. In this, too,
the later and more perfect manner is increasingly present
throughout; and, naturally, still more so in the Fifth, where
the dates bring us to the very eve of the great period itself,
and the essays are sometimes hardly distinguishable from the
work thereof. The very best of these, perhaps, are the three
classical pieces (for Sainte-Beuve was never prudish about
titles, and not more than half of the Portraits in this volume
deal with contemporaries in any sense) on Homer, Apollonius
Rhodius, and Meleager, in which, not for the first time, but for
the first time in nearly or quite his full force, he once more
makes a new departure in criticism by handling antiquity in
true <span lang="la"><i>causerie</i></span> style. But the <span lang="fr">“Desaugiers,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“Louise Labé,”</span>
and the <span lang="fr">“Casimir Delavigne”</span> are also noteworthy, while the
paper on Gautier’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Grotesques</cite></span>, a little meticulous and pedagogic
in parts, and written in avowed protest of a mild kind,
is still more so.<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c010'><sup>[584]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>He “arrives.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In fact, by about 1845<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c010'><sup>[585]</sup></a> he had very nearly developed his
full powers, and he was shaking off the awkward transition
state when he had ceased to be <span lang="fr"><i>romantique  à
plusieurs</i></span> (he never was <span lang="fr"><i>à tous</i></span>) <span lang="fr"><i>crins</i></span>, and not yet
become  himself, and himself only. He had almost accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>, the mixture of biography, and criticism,
and “talk about it,” which Dryden, I maintain, is the first
to have actually hit upon, which Johnson had strengthened
but a little stiffened in the <cite>Lives</cite>, and which he himself re-fashioned
by taking hints of depth and insight from Coleridge
and the English Companions, touches of grace and <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span>
out of a score of French eighteenth-century critics, from Fontenelle
and Diderot down to Fontanes and Daunou, adding
knowledge of literary history, and a not too peremptory theory
of time and <span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>, from the Germans and the ambient air,
enthusiasm from the still smouldering hearth of the deserted
<span lang="fr"><i>cénacle</i></span>, and that magic and indefinable dose, that “little of
my own sauce,” as Mrs Tibbs has it, which genius provides,
and of which it keeps the secret. His ability to concoct this
mixture, or rather to produce this new organism, had been by
this time almost fully shown; but the final proof was given,
and the new kind was definitely named and sent abroad, only
after the composition of the most substantive work (except
<cite>Port-Royal</cite>) which he had yet attempted, and the best—itself
displaying the gifts he had now acquired in the fullest measure.
Probably the critical moment was hastened, as so often happens,
by an external catastrophe, the upset of the July Monarchy,
and by that transplantation into Belgium for a time which,
though he has put the best face on it, was certainly an exile,
and by no means wholly a voluntary one.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Port-Royal,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We must, however, first take some notice of <cite>Port-Royal</cite>,
which, either by cause or coincidence, was also the product
of a journey, if not an exile, being originally delivered
in the form of lectures at Lausanne. It<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c010'><sup>[586]</sup></a>
is, of course, the most important and substantive single work
of its author—the only one, in fact, to which the older and
more exacting definition of a <em>book</em> would have shown itself
complaisant. It occupied, with completions and revisions,
twenty years of his life; it contains perhaps the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>elaborate and masterly exposition of that system of combined
literary, historical, and social inquiry into the life of a period
which he did so much to introduce, and so much more to
establish as a literary Kind; and it expresses and registers
notably those changes of opinion which made him, in the
last two decades of his life, an exponent of an almost entirely
<em>irreligious</em> view of life itself. With this aspect of it we do
not here concern ourselves; but the book has far too much
which does directly concern us, in the strictest construction
of our own plan, not to receive detailed attention.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>its literary episodes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I do not know that those “older and more exacting
definitions,” which have been just referred to, would pass,
without demur, the features which make it of this
importance to us. It is true that many, if not most,
of the more distinguished men of letters of that century which,
in the general judgment, has been regarded as the greatest
century of letters in France, had more or less connection with
Port Royal: nay, more, that not a few of the Port Royalists
of the outer and even inner circles were great men of
letters themselves. But whether this entirely justifies (to
take examples from the first two volumes only) the inclusion
in the book of analyses of <span lang="fr"><cite>Polyeucte</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Saint-Genest</cite></span>, which
would be ample for extensive monographs on Corneille and
Rotrou respectively,—of an elaborate study of the elder
Balzac of which the same may be said,—is a very arguable
point. Still, the inclusion gives us the book; and, even if
it did not, I am not inclined to be strait-laced on these
points, or to chicane about the relation of the episodes to
the epic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us then be as kind to Sainte-Beuve as he was to himself,
and admit what (feeling, I suppose, uneasy) he pleads at vol. ii.
p. 107, “Nous voici, ce semble, bien loin de Port Royal; pas si
loin que l’on croit”—that the spirit of the two plays is quite
Port-Royalist, that Balzac wrote letters to M. de Saint-Cyran
(so he did to most people, but no matter), that Pascal, Nicole,
Racine come in of course; that even the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires de Grammont</cite></span>
are not quite extraneous, for was not <span lang="fr"><i>la belle</i></span> Hamilton herself
(despite her <span lang="fr"><i>nez retroussé</i></span> and her Cupid’s-bow mouth) educated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>there? We are, in short, to take our literary goods as we find
them, and as fate and the author provide: and they certainly
provide them in plenty. No detailed examinations of Sainte-Beuve’s
are more careful than those of the two plays. If he
is a little hard, in the text, on that Christian (and semi-Gascon)
Socrates, and writer of most handsome letters, who dwelt on
the banks of the Charente, he repairs it in an appendix. The
references to minor Louis XIII. literature (though injured by
Sainte-Beuve’s dislike to quaintness) are never to be missed:
and it is needless to say the same of the whole dealing
with Pascal, and of the chapters devoted to the famous
labours of the Port-Royalists themselves, in literary and
philosophical education. Tillemont, if not exactly a lion in
literature, is one of the greatest of lion’s providers therein,
and Nicole cannot be denied the title of man of letters.
Malebranche comes in as an opponent, Racine as a pupil,
though as an ungrateful pupil: and on all these and others
Sainte-Beuve indulges in literary excursus of all but his best
kind.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Racine.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Racine passage is the best worth dwelling on of these,
because what Frenchmen say on Racine is always interesting.
We know, of course, beforehand that Sainte-Beuve
will be, to a certain extent, <span lang="fr"><i>juste-milieu</i></span>,—that he
will neither be of those who denounce with rage, <a id='err312.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='errata' title='or'>nor</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#e_312.24'><ins class='correction' title='or'>nor</ins></a></span> deplore
with pity or contempt, the poor foreigners who cannot hear the
celestial music of the great <span lang="fr"><i>doucereux</i></span>, nor of those who approach
more or less nearly to the view of the poor foreigners
themselves. But the piece is specially interesting because it
is perhaps the most distinct general retractation of the critic’s
ultra-Romantic creed, and because it expresses much the same
views as those (very probably derived from it) of Mr Arnold.
You must not, says Sainte-Beuve, attempt to judge Racine by
<span lang="fr"><i>passages</i></span>; there Hugo, Lamartine, even much lesser moderns
will beat him. You must judge the whole, and take into consideration
the support which each part gives to, and in turn
derives from, the others. Nay, more, Racine is <span lang="fr">“moins imprévu,
moins éclatant, moins héroïque, moins transportant”</span>
than Corneille, but more “equal,” &#38;c. <span lang="fr">“L’unité, l’ensemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>chez Racine se subordonne tout.”</span> Sainte-Beuve even thinks
that he could have done the many poetic things that he did
not do as well as those which he did, and that in them (here
we may all agree) <span lang="fr">“on aurait le même Racine.”</span> But did he
not lose something under the desperate hook of Boileau?
Perhaps. <span lang="fr">“Il n’avait pas un démon déterminé.”</span> You can
understand him at once as you cannot Shakespeare or Molière.
He presents the perfection of poetic style, <span lang="fr"><i>même pour ceux qui
n’aiment pas essentiellement la poésie</i></span>. And the critic, with what
some, I suppose, would call a touch of his “perfidy,” adds, <span lang="fr">“Là,
c’est le point faible, s’il en est un.”</span> Let us rather say that,
while all reasonable praise of Racine may be read in the lines
of this criticism, all reasonable dispraise of him may be read
between those lines.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Chateaubriand et son Groupe Littéraire.</div>

<p class='c001'>The great critical truth, that not merely is the tongue of
the critic loosed but his eyes are opened by the death of his
subject, has seldom been better illustrated than by
the volumes entitled <span lang="fr"><cite>Chateaubriand et son Groupe
Littéraire</cite></span>, originally delivered as lectures at Liége
when Sainte-Beuve had left France to the March-haredom
of the Second Republic. Of course we must remember
that he had had more than twenty years of critical
practice wherein to grow in critical wisdom and stature; that
in the last sixteen or seventeen, especially, since he had shed
his Saint-Simonian and Lamennaisian crotchets, he had (losing
some fancy and enthusiasm with them) acquired immensely
greater knowledge, critical delicacy, critical insight in most
ways; and that, accordingly, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits</cite></span> and other pieces of
the ’Forties are, in almost every respect except romantic and
poetic <span lang="la"><i>furia</i></span>, superior to those of the ’Thirties. But this will
not entirely account for the excellence of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chateaubriand</cite></span>,
which is a sort of central “broad” in the stream of Sainte-Beuve’s
criticism, from which it flows thereafter ever deeper,
wider, and clearer. The book indeed is not—what book, and
especially what critical book, is?—to be praised unreservedly
or with very slight reserves. The common accusations of
“envy,” “treachery,” “malignity,” “intolerance of greatness,”
and the like, brought against Sainte-Beuve, are exaggerated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>at the best, and at the worst simply silly. They come partly
from the general dislike and suspicion of the critic, who is a
critic wholly or mainly, partly from unintelligent, if not
quite ungenerous partisanship, partly from the most polluted
of all sources, personal and spiteful gossip. But, as nearly
always happens, there is some shred of justification for them,
and the matter is important enough to be dealt with once for
all here.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Faults found with it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Rarely—so rarely that it is an almost unknown event—shall
a man practise, as Sainte-Beuve had for years and decades
been practising, criticism of his contemporaries and
in many cases friends, without exciting ill-feeling.
But that ill-feeling becomes still more certain, and its complexion
is likely to be darker, when the criticism is of the
peculiar character which it is Sainte-Beuve’s greatest claim
in the general view (not quite in mine) to have perfected,
if not actually invented. It is true that, in the case of his
living subjects, he moves about, among the extra-literary
personal traits, which it is his delight to assemble and to group
beside the literary details in heightening or contrasting light,
with a cat-like dexterity. But even cats sometimes upset
things: and the things among which Sainte-Beuve moved were
much more ticklish and unstable than the objects of the cat’s
legerde<span lang="fr"><i>pied</i></span>. Moreover, he actually had, as some, though by
no means all other great critics have had, a certain predilection
for the secondary. He never quite attains to the Longinian
soundness of view on the faults-and-beauties question; and
it is particularly unfortunate that the two greatest men of
letters of his own time and country, Chateaubriand and Victor
Hugo, were men who specially require a Longinian judgment.
Nor am I disposed to deny that his attitude towards the great
<span lang="it"><cite>Beltenebroso</cite></span> of French Literature “doth something smack; doth
a little grow to.” Sainte-Beuve’s strange Bonapartism—the
strangest instance<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c010'><sup>[587]</sup></a> of that most incomprehensible of political
faiths—may have had a little to do with this: but one suspects,
putting gossip aside, something more. There was, no doubt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>much injustice in the too famous <span lang="fr">“Mérimée était gentilhomme:
Sainte-Beuve ne l'était pas,”</span> but there was an infinitesimal
something in it.<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c010'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Again, to pass to a less “scabrous” subject, the scheme of
the book leaves a very little to desire: it may be argued, with
some justice, that Sainte-Beuve might better have proceeded
entirely by the planet-and-satellite method which he has partly
adopted, instead of sometimes mixing planet and satellite up,
and sometimes keeping them separate.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its extraordinary merits,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But the critical merits of the book are quite extraordinary.
I know nothing earlier even approaching it as a comprehensive
review of a great writer; and the details
are even more admirable than the admirable <span lang="fr"><i>ensemble</i></span>.
As for the latter, whatever may be Sainte-Beuve’s
insinuations, whatever his want of cordiality for
Chateaubriand the man and the politician,<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c010'><sup>[589]</sup></a> it is impossible
to charge him with the least inadequacy as regards Chateaubriand
the writer. Like others, he dwells a little too much
on the obligatory “images”; but unlike others, he does not
limit Chateaubriand’s powers to them; and he is more likely
to be thought by foreign critics excessive than grudging in
his assignment and recognition of those powers. He does the
amplest justice to the immense advance, in intensity and range,
of “René” over Bernardin and Jean Jacques. He sees perfectly
well that the best and most characteristic part of Byron
is only Chateaubriand in English, in verse, with a few more
yataghans, and with no crucifixes. He has here gone nearer,
I think, to a real “grasp” of the writer, and the whole
writer (alas! not of nothing but the writer) than in any other
instance.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the details, one simply punctuates the book with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>bravo!s, if reading merely for enjoyment, and the note-book
is never out of one’s hand if one is reading for reference. It
“enfists” you, as the French say, at once, and it never lets the
grasp go, but tightens it ever again and again. Take the admirable
conclusion of the second Lecture,<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c010'><sup>[590]</sup></a> with its indication
of the way in which Chateaubriand combines the appeal of
ancient poetry, of mediæval romance, and of the new fancy for
nature, and turn, or rather come (for there should be no turning
or skipping in this book) to the justification of the last
point in the Fourth.<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c010'><sup>[591]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and final</i> dicta.</div>

<p class='c001'>But it is at the end of the Seventh lecture, in the special
critique of <span lang="fr"><cite>Atala</cite></span>, that Sainte-Beuve first, I think, shows the
wonderful critical mastery which was to distinguish
him for the remaining twenty years of his life; and
the proofs multiply as we turn the pages. In whom elsewhere—even
in Coleridge—shall we find two such sentences, on the
<span lang="la"><i>verso</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>recto</i></span> of the same leaf,<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c010'><sup>[592]</sup></a> showing such different kinds
not merely of mastery but of supremacy as those that follow—the
last of the Eighth lecture, and, save for a mere bow to the
audience, the first of the Ninth? He has, in the first, been
contrasting <span lang="fr"><cite>Paul et Virginie</cite></span> (for which he, like almost all
Frenchmen, has an affection incomprehensible to us), and he
has to admit the transcendence of its successor. <span lang="fr">“Elle [Atala]
gardait,”</span> he says, <span lang="fr">“son ascendant troublant: au milieu de
toutes les reserves qu’une saine critique oppose, la flamme
divine y a passé.... On y sent le philtre—le poison qui,
une fois connu, ne se guérit pas; on emporte avec soi la flèche
empoisonnée du désert.”</span> <span lang="la"><i>Dixit!</i></span> There are critics who feel
the philtre and who carry the arrow with them, and there are
those who do not.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other passage is, <span lang="fr"><span lang="fr">“Savoir bien lire un livre en le jugeant
chemin faisant, et sans cesser de le goûter, c’est presque tout
l’art du critique. Cet art consiste encore à comparer....
Faites cela, et laissez-vous faire.”</span></span> How different this cool prescription
from the enthusiasm of the last, and yet how equal
in its finality!</p>

<p class='c001'>I could bestow much more of my tediousness on the reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>in regard to this wonderful book: but its allotted space is
nearly filled. Once only do I find a pettiness, in fact a falsity,
where<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c010'><sup>[593]</sup></a> he carps at the phrase, <span lang="fr">“A combien de rivages n’ai-je
pas vu depuis se briser les mêmes flots que je contemple ici,”</span>
in the truly Rymerian note, <span lang="fr"><span lang="fr">“Tout les flots se ressemblent:
mais ce ne sont pas les <em>mêmes</em> flots, les <em>mêmes</em> vagues qu’il
voyait se briser en des lieux si divers.”</span></span> The <span lang="fr"><i>poète mort jeune</i></span>
in Sainte-Beuve (to use his own famous words) was <span lang="fr"><i>bien mort</i></span>
when he wrote this: and the critic had <em>not</em> “felt the philtre.”
Does not the greater part of the power of the Angel of the
Sea arise from this very mysterious sense of the unity of wave
from Pole to Equator, and from coral to iceberg? The lands
are broken, separated, isolated: the “unplumbed, salt, estranging
sea” is one and indivisible, an unbroken link between the
live self that sees it here and the dead self that saw it far away
and long ago.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he seldom slips or nods thus. For happier things, note
his sketch<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c010'><sup>[594]</sup></a> of the three manners in Chateaubriand, where he
compares Fontenelle’s notice of Corneille’s,<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c010'><sup>[595]</sup></a> and might have
compared Milton’s; the confession that French is not <span lang="fr">“une
langue qui aurait eu l’accent et qui se souvenait d’avoir étée
scandée”</span>; the profound remarks on the Kinds of Criticism;<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c010'><sup>[596]</sup></a>
the almost profounder remarks on the different kinds of description.<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c010'><sup>[597]</sup></a>
I could multiply these instances almost endlessly, but it is
enough to say, or repeat, that if we had nothing else of Sainte-Beuve’s
it would place him in the first rank of the critics
of the world, and that it is perhaps the earliest book that
definitely does so.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Causeries</span> <i>at last</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Although the rest of Sainte-Beuve’s life certainly did not
fail to justify the immortal and invariable law that the gods
never yet gave all things to man at once, yet in
the main it was exceptionally fortunate, and the
fortune was of the kind most important to our
purpose. For once, a man who could do a thing supremely
was allowed to do it, under conditions, if not absolutely ideal,
yet exceptionally favourable. Had he resisted the temptations
of professorships and senatorships, he would have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>able, without any interruption, to devote himself entirely to
literary work of his own choosing, in his own house, without
let or hindrance, publicity or disturbance, without even the
pressure (so galling to some temperaments) of any fixed time
and place of duty, except the easily adjustable necessities of
having his “copy” and his proofs duly ready. Even of the
avocations which he permitted himself, the actual interference
with his vocation was trifling. The reward in mere money,
though of course ludicrous in comparison with the rewards of
other professions or even arts, was a competence; and it freed
him completely from one of the most disagreeable penances of
the working man of letters, the necessity of stepping out of his
proper sphere in order to keep himself within it.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this amiability of the Destinies, and with the man
himself so perfectly prepared as we have seen him to be, it is
scarcely surprising that the work should be altogether exceptional.
It would require a really “encyclopædic head” either
to affirm or deny, with competence, the proposition that it is
the most complete and four-square batch of work ever done by
any craftsman: but I do not know where to look for its rival,
in any branch at least of literature. Criticism may or may
not be the lowest of such branches; it may or may not be
unworthy even to be called a branch. But of it, and barring
the previous question, we shall certainly look in vain anywhere
for such an example, in quality and quantity combined,
as is presented by the <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries du Lundi</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux
Lundis</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their length, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I do not know whether the length of the average <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>
was directly conditioned by the fact of its appearance in a
daily newspaper<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c010'><sup>[598]</sup></a> instead of a Review, or whether
Sainte-Beuve’s experience and instinct combined,
induced him to make it rather shorter, but much more uniform
in length, than his <span lang="fr"><cite>Deux Mondes</cite></span> articles. This length is pretty
exactly twenty pages—a few articles being a little longer and
a few a little shorter, but the greater number coming very
close to the score of, say, 350 words each. It may be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>superstition based on this great practitioner’s practice, but I
think the majority of his successors have found that this
length—say, from six to eight thousand words—is singularly
normal for the treatment of an average subject of the larger
literary kind. It ought not to weary the reader; it does not
cramp the writer; and it does not tempt him to undue expatiation.
Occasionally Sainte-Beuve, of course, doubled or
trebled or even further multiplied <span lang="fr"><i>causeries</i></span> where the subject
demanded it; but at first he did this very seldom, and he
never made it the rule. In selecting his subjects he naturally
preferred a new book when he could get it, if only as a
“peg”: and he had plenty of choice. His rejections, however,
were sometimes disappointing, particularly so in the case of
M. Egger’s <cite>History of Greek Criticism</cite>, which he had intended
to take. He neither specially chose nor specially rejected
themes that he had already treated: and sometimes, though
not often, he reproduced parts of his old work. As to the
treatment, enough has been said of that above, or will be said
below. It was almost unique: it is still almost unmatched.
As far as any general scheme is extricable, it is the obvious
one of a few general remarks—not very seldom expanding into
precious tractatules—of more or less abstract criticism; a biographical
sketch, anecdoted with special view to literary influences;
remarks, with more or less quotation, on books and
passages; and sometimes a sketch, usually rather shy and
suggestive than peremptory, of comparative “placing”—the
comparison, however, having been subtly presented throughout.
But the method is never stereotyped: and the variations are of
the essence.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Bricks of the house.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The hundreds of articles and the thousands of passages which
these eight-and-twenty volumes present are naturally difficult
to deal with after the method which has been
here adopted; but a few pages may be fairly devoted
to a selection from the <span lang="la"><i>notabilia</i></span> with which “the sweet
compulsion” of reading them through again for the purpose
has provided me freshly. At the very beginning, and in
the first volume, though it is one of the most brilliant of
all, Sainte-Beuve is rather militant: he never became quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Olympian. The opening article on Saint-Marc Girardin<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c010'><sup>[599]</sup></a> (between
whom and our critic there was always a little friction)
has a good deal of “malice” in the French, if not exactly in
the English, sense: and that which follows on Lamartine’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Confidences</cite></span>, with a later one on <span lang="fr"><cite>Raphael</cite></span>, though just enough,
is distinctly cruel, and savours of political vengeance on the
fallen dictator. But these ticklish and disgustful contemporaneities
give way to those perfect studies of the Sévignés
(if it be not profane to speak of that person in the plural), the
Hamiltons, the Jouberts, the Comines, the Firdousis, which
we associate most happily and most characteristically with
Sainte-Beuve. There is less, though there is some, of the
wholly welcome dealing with technically “ancient” literature:
but there are two consummate articles of “criticism in the
second intention”—the papers on “Villemain and Cousin as
Men of Letters,” and on “Feletz, and Empire Criticism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The second volume or semester of this Annus Mirabilis—for
the two cover the whole <a id='corr320.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='twelvemouth'>twelvemonth</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_320.18'><ins class='correction' title='twelvemouth'>twelvemonth</ins></a></span> from October 1 to
September 30, 1849-1850, with exactly fifty-two articles told
down for the fifty-two weeks<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c010'><sup>[600]</sup></a>—contains the famous and
generous “Mlle. de Lespinasse”; the “Huet,” which is perhaps
as good an example as one can find of the whole in some
ways; the admirable “Chesterfield”; a wonderfully just
“Mazarin”; the “Gil Blas,” which will be reprinted with
<cite>Gil Blas</cite> for centuries; and that magnanimous and yet not
uncritical adjustment of coals of fire which Sainte-Beuve set
alight in honour of the death of Balzac,—all of them varied,
picked out, and set off by a profusion of studies of the eighteenth
century, less literary in substance but literary enough in connection,
and prefaced in one case, that of the <span lang="fr">“Madame du
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Châtelet,”</span> with a most ingenious link, conduit, or what shall
we call it? of explanatory connection between the purely
literary and the merely gossiping. If there is to be found, also,
an extremely bitter-sweet appendix on M. de Pontmartin,
and an article on Chateaubriand, which is a superfluity and
a blunder after the great book, we can pardon them. No other
man has ever done such another year’s <span lang="fr"><i>darg</i></span> in criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must not follow the rest of the twenty years or thereabouts
with equal precision, though few of them were less
substantially filled. An indication to those who do not know,
a reminder to those who do, of certain <span lang="fr"><i>sommités</i></span> among the
articles; and a small sheaf of specially important passages,
may lead us to the final summary of Sainte-Beuve’s critical
position and achievement.</p>

<p class='c001'>A whole cluster of remarkable things opens the Third volume.
The “Rabelais” is practically the first piece of absolutely sane
and appreciative criticism on the subject, the starting-point
and foundation of what is now the accepted opinion of the
competent. The “<span lang="fr"><i>Qu’est ce qu’un classique?</i></span>” is one of those
more general pieces of criticism in which Sainte-Beuve does
not go out of his way to indulge, but which he does, when he
does them, in a manner showing the superiority which
practice in actual “judging of authors” confers on its practitioners
when they “go up higher.” The “Rousseau” is
almost equal to the “Rabelais,” and it is not the first comer
in criticism who can be just to both. His social-historic
studies of the seventeenth and the eighteenth century serve
as foils, and as intrinsically delightful reading, though they
are often on the fringes of literature itself. The article on
Latouche is a little ungenerous, and that on Fontenelle more
than a little inadequate; while I wish that Sainte-Beuve had
not indulged in a singularly vain and violent contrast between
Camille Desmoulins and Vauvenargues. But the “Pasquier,”
the “Saint-Simon,” the new “Diderot,” make amends.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His occasional polemic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And it is always so. There were squalls occasionally, as
there were especially certain to be, at the ticklish time,
when the Second Consulate or Presidency was passing, not
quite ideally, into the Second Empire. He need not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>poured broadsides into popgunners like the Staël-Hetzels and
the Laurent-Pichats.<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c010'><sup>[601]</sup></a> The first was a very useful
publisher and a respectable author of children’s
books; I think I remember some tolerable critical
work of the second, apart from his politics. But what is
either to-day? what, much more, will either be a hundred
years hence, beside Sainte-Beuve? He knew Wordsworth:
surely he might have remembered that “our noisy <em>curs</em> are”
not even “moments in the being of the Eternal Silence.”
“They yap; what yap they? let them yap.” For in some
cases they can do nothing else: and in all the Silence itself
catches them very soon, if we do not lend them an echo.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Fourth volume, though the <span lang="fr">“Mirabeau”</span> articles and
the <span lang="fr">“Chamfort,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“Saint-Evremond et Ninon”</span> and the
<span lang="fr">“Marmontel”</span> are charming in the mixed kind, I think, for
literature, the palm is due to that sentence—so autobiographical
and so much more than merely autobiographical—which opens
the <span lang="fr">“Moreau and Dupont”</span> piece, <span lang="fr">“Je cause rarement ici de
poésie, precisément parceque je l’ai beaucoup aimée et que je
l’aime encore plus que toute chose.”</span> <span lang="la"><i>Quia multum amavi!</i></span>
And he does not derogate from this attitude in the Fifth, where
he welcomes Victor de Laprade and Leconte de Lisle, while
this also contains delightful things on Raynouard, Rivarol,
Retz, Patru, Gourville, and even the remarkable person once
called Le-Brun-<span lang="fr"><cite>Pindare</cite></span>. In the Sixth we go from Rollin to
La Reine Margot, from Bernardin and Courier to Saint Anselm
backwards and the Abbé Gerbet forwards, with, at the close,
one article of special interest here, Sainte-Beuve’s revised and
in some ways <em>palinodic</em> opinions on Boileau. The Seventh is
mainly eighteenth century—Montesquieu and the Président de
Brosses, Franklin and Barthélemy, Grimm (for whom, here as
elsewhere, Sainte-Beuve makes strong fight against the general,
and, I am bound to say, in my judgment, the well-grounded,
distrust of him), Necker and Volney, with, to give us change
from a better time, Regnard and La Fontaine at front and close,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Richelieu and Saint François de Sales, Mérimée and Arnault,
and the elder Marguerite. On the last he is a little disappointing:
and perhaps we might have expected that he would be.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Eighth, with many excellent examples of the usual
seventeenth-eighteenth century <span lang="fr"><i>causeries</i></span>, and with a most welcome
batch of mediæval studies on Joinville, on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman
de Renart</cite></span>, on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Littéraire</cite></span>—good to read even now,
and priceless then—contains an article, written with great care,
to which an Englishman naturally turns, and with which most
Englishmen will be disappointed, that on Gibbon. None of
the usual causes could have blunted Sainte-Beuve’s judgment
here: yet it is blunted. Missing, in the one sense, what he
calls the <span lang="fr"><i>javelot</i></span>, the <span lang="fr"><i>coup de foudre</i></span>, the <span lang="fr"><i>cri haletant</i></span>—in other
words, the somewhat theatrical and rhetorical<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c010'><sup>[602]</sup></a> touch of French,
he misses also, in the other, Gibbon’s <em>magnificence</em>, that sense
of the vast procession of events and that power of reproducing
it, which gives an almost poetic self-transcendence to an otherwise
prosaic and <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span> nature. We all miss things, of
course: but such a man as Sainte-Beuve should not have
missed such a thing as this. The <span lang="fr">“Joinville,”</span> however, which
immediately follows, makes once more those familiar amends;
and the next volume (the Ninth) contains admirable companions
to it in the <span lang="fr">“Froissart”</span> and the <span lang="fr">“Villehardouin,”</span> this last one
of the author’s best. He had now started (to some though not
to all extents with advantage) dealing with one subject in
several essays: and most of this volume is so occupied.
<span lang="fr">“Stendhal,”</span> <span lang="fr">“Marivaux,”</span> <span lang="fr">“Madame Dacier,”</span> with others, show
his admirable flexibility. The Tenth is perhaps less attractive,
for except Agrippa d’Aubigné and one or two others, its subjects
are not as a rule of the first interest, and in one Sainte-Beuve
returns to Chateaubriand—not happily. But the Eleventh,
with a certain amount of “filling,”—the first collection stopped
here, and Sainte-Beuve had to plug the gap made by the
removal of the index when it was extended,—has at least two
articles, or batches of articles, of the first interest—those on
Montluc and Cowper. <span lang="fr"><i>Ne fait pas ce tour qui veut</i></span>—to appreciate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>equally, and almost at the same moment, the greater
d’Artagnan of Sienna and the patron of Puss.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, the original enterprise of the weekly
<span lang="fr"><cite>Causerie</cite></span> did in a manner finish with this first issue. For five
years Sainte-Beuve had kept neck and neck with the enemy.
His work afterwards was more intermittent, and even underwent
a cessation of some years when he was lecturer at the
École Normale, between 1857 and 1861. The last four volumes
of the actual <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries</cite></span> are made up from different sources:
though the bulk of the constituents are of the true breed.
Among them are some of Sainte-Beuve’s most interesting
studies of the past—<span lang="fr">“Ronsard”</span> (revisited), <span lang="fr">“Saint Amant,”</span>
<span lang="fr">“Voiture,”</span> <span lang="fr">“Vauvenargues,”</span> “Villon”—and some of his most
famous papers on contemporaries, such as those on Musset and
the Guérins. The last volume of all contains two of the most
valuable of those invaluable papers on criticism in general,
to which we have drawn attention already, that on Nisard’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>History</cite></span> and that on <span lang="fr"><cite>La Tradition en Littérature</cite></span>. But perhaps
the special appeal of these appendix-volumes is the appearance
of articles on books and authors that are still in a manner
modern—on <span lang="fr"><cite>Madame Bovary</cite></span>, on <cite>Fanny</cite>,<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c010'><sup>[603]</sup></a> on M. de Banville,
on M. Scherer.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Nouveaux Lundis.</div>

<p class='c001'>And when the series began again regularly, after this interruption,
with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux Lundis</cite></span> in 1861, he formally
promised or threatened a recrudescence into criticism
“truer” and “franker” and more regardless
of contemporary protest.</p>

<p class='c001'>One may be sorry for this, even though the particular ashes
are long cooled. Although Sainte-Beuve’s “malignity” was, as
has been said, absurdly, and is still sometimes inexcusably,
exaggerated, he was far from free from those <span lang="la"><i>iræ</i></span> from which
the something less than celestial spirit of the critic so seldom
escapes.<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c010'><sup>[604]</sup></a> There is a sort of “rankle,” a kind of distant growl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>of “That’s <em>my</em> thunder,” in his review at the time of M.
Rigault’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Querelle</cite></span>, in his later obituary of the author, and
even elsewhere: the first paper of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux Lundis</cite></span> on
Laprade is openly and almost rudely hostile: while the critic
proceeds later to exchange fresh broadsides with M. de Pontmartin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, where the element of hostility or personality does not
put flies in the ointment, it is of course of the first interest
to have such a paper as, say, the “<span lang="fr"><cite>Madame Bovary</cite></span>” article,
or the later one on <span lang="fr">“Salammbô,”</span> introductions to such rising
“imps of fame” as Taine, Renan, the Goncourts, Saint-Victor,
Fromentin, Feuillet,—even such fair and well-weighed, though
antagonistic, examinations as that of Veuillot. In regard to
Taine and others, especially, Sainte-Beuve is particularly interesting,
because they present a crop of his seed, a development
of his own method, with the substitution, for that rather
<span lang="fr"><i>ondoyant et divers</i></span> conclusion or no-conclusion of his to which
we shall return, of hard-and-fast theories of ruling ideas, and
<span lang="fr"><i>milieux</i></span>, and the rest. All this, however, would not make up
to those of us who love the modern <span lang="la"><i>quâ</i></span> modern little and
the contemporary <span lang="la"><i>quâ</i></span> contemporary not at all, if it had induced
Sainte-Beuve to give up those inestimable studies of
the past, or those well-reasoned considerations of criticism
in general, which are his main titles to fame. But it did not.
One of the very best of the latter kind is the famous review
of M. Taine’s own <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise</cite></span>. And
in the former, the <span lang="fr">“La Bruyère,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“Sévigné,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“Perrault”</span>
in the first volume, the <span lang="fr">“Bossuet”</span> in the second, the article
(independent of his “Introduction,” which is itself a masterpiece)
to Crepet’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Poètes Français</cite></span>, and the batch on the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Mystère d’Orleans</cite></span> (that is to say, the Early French Drama) in
the third are more than reassuring. Soon, moreover, <span lang="fr"><cite>Daphnis
and Chloe</cite></span> promises a renewal<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c010'><sup>[605]</sup></a> of those articles on the classics
which are perhaps the only ones ever written, since our regrettable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>specialisations in the nineteenth century, by a
literary critic of the very first order in the modern sphere.<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c010'><sup>[606]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the last he turned a little too much to the political,
and though at the very end the long batch on Talleyrand is
succeeded by one equally long on his old favourite, Madame
Desbordes-Valmore, the amiable Marceline is not quite a
poetess of importance enough, nor is the part actually devoted
to her poetry large enough, to make the swan-song quite
literary. But there is plenty of genuine matter everywhere,
and even the contemporary articles afford room for justice at
last to Gautier, and for a long and attractive review of <span lang="fr"><cite>La
Poesie en 1865</cite></span>, where M. Sully Prudhomme, and others not
even yet quite out of fashion, appear. It may be that something
of the irrational and superstitious <span lang="fr"><i>guignon</i></span> of continuations
attaches to these <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux Lundis</cite></span>: but surely very
little.<a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c010'><sup>[607]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The conclusion of this matter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Why more? Indeed, save to observe the proportion and
method of the book (which are of the first importance), and
to pay proper respect to a prince in the critical
Israel (which is hardly of less), why so much?
Except for the vast bulk of his work, and for the
fact that it is not collected into definite “Works,” but exists
under a large number of separate headings, some of which
may be overlooked, Sainte-Beuve’s criticism offers itself with
almost every advantage and facility to the reader. It has to
the full those superficial attractions of “readableness” which
have given to French criticism its popular position; and it
lacks those superficialities in the other sense, which detract
from the value of French criticism so often. The immense
variety not merely provides something specially interesting
for almost everybody who has any literary, historical, or,
one might almost say, intellectual interests at all, but prevents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>tedium or satiety in those whose interests are wider.
The style, though neither coruscating, nor treacly, nor enigmatic,
is—in its perfection and when it has outgrown some
early defects—“the model of the middle style” in criticism,
suitable for the purpose and the writer’s temperament. It
can say anything that the author wishes to say, and does
not try to say what he cannot.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we must examine the results which he gives a little
more closely before concluding, and, according to the good
old plan, take the deficiencies, or the want of supremacies,
first. As has been put, with examples, above, Sainte-Beuve
is not entirely to be trusted with the out-of-the-way, the
eccentric, even the abnormally great. The very <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span> of the
critic exposes him to this, and the opposite fault—the <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span>
for everything that <em>is</em> out of the way, that <em>is</em>
eccentric, that <em>is</em> abnormal, whether great or not—is not
merely an excess of a critical virtue, but a serious, an
almost disqualifying critical defect. Still, to be able to
admire and recognise the “earth-born and absolute fire”<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c010'><sup>[608]</sup></a>
is, if not a critical <span lang="la"><i>sine qua non</i></span>—for without it the critic
may do good work—yet his rarest and noblest gift. Sainte-Beuve
had it not quite.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is room for more difference of competent opinion as
to his abstinence from the most definite posing and placing—from
the final arrangement of his portraits exactly as he
wished to have them seen by his readers, and to stand in
relation to each other. There is, of course, its own merit in
that abstinence, which is (as it was in the earlier case of
Villemain) something of a reaction from the fondness of his
“Empire” predecessors for the trenchant, the peremptory,
the official distinction and ticket. There had been very much
too much of this during the Neo-classic period; and there has
been, to put it mildly, quite enough and to spare of it since.
Nevertheless, one may think that Sainte-Beuve, though he
never, as his countrymen too often do, leaves you uninformed,
does too often leave you floating—undecided even as to what
his own definite view of the man’s or work’s value, relation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>position, may be. Now this surely is a slight defect. When
one wants a picture, one does not want merely a sheet of
drawing-paper, with the most accurate and “genial” studies
of eye, nose, chin, mouth, hair, scattered anyhow about it,
but the complete, or at any rate the outlined, face made up
from these studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>I can think of no general fault save these two, and we are
not now to hark back to particulars. The tale of general
and particular excellences is more agreeable to construct, but
more difficult to put in little. The head and front of Sainte-Beuve’s
critical welldoing he has himself put excellently and
more than once. To read; to understand; to love:—and then
to facilitate reading, understanding, and loving on the part
of others—these are the first and second great commandments
of the critic. And few, surely, have obeyed them better. He
may be a little cumbered about much serving—we do not
(that is those of us who want criticism) always want such
Persic apparatus of biography and history and gossip. But
the Persic apparatus is very agreeable in itself, and sometimes
even not useless. And there is plenty of the plain leg of
critical mutton—well fed, well killed, well kept, and well
dressed. Only perhaps a certain degree of expertness can
fully appreciate, but ordinary sense and taste must surely
not fail to perceive, the range of reading which is—be it again
and again repeated—in all but the most extraordinary cases
the <span lang="la"><i>necessarium</i></span>, if not the <span lang="la"><i>unum necessarium</i></span>, of the critic.
Common-sense and taste are perhaps at least equally well
prepared with the expertest <em>expertise</em> to recognise, if they are
given their way, the sanity and the equity, the patience and
the thoroughness, the freedom from crotchet and caprice, from
the merely parochial and the merely particularist, which distinguish
Sainte-Beuve from almost all other critics. He was,
as we have seen, very lucky; few have had at once his gifts,
and his opportunities of exercising them, and that rarest and
happiest gift of “the Hour,” without which Gift, and even
in some sense Opportunity, will fail to estate a man in his
proper place. But the Hour has seldom found the Man so
ready: and the Man has in no single instance in our department,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>and in few throughout all, requited the Hour by leaving
such fruits of it for all time to come.</p>

<p class='c014'>The general discussion of the Classic-Romantic quarrel—so
far as we can deal with it—will be for the Interchapters; and
it is not even very easy here to make a methodic distinction
between the names who will best appear in this chronicle
side by side with Sainte-Beuve, and those who should figure
in the corresponding chapter of the next Book as his successors.
But applying something of the same method which has helped
us before, we may perhaps most conveniently group beside
him Victor Hugo as a matter of course, with, of the rest,
five representative figures—Gautier for the Romantic farthest,
the out-and-out partisans of “art-for-art”; Nisard for the
Classical reaction; Saint-Marc Girardin as an example of
that Academic criticism which has always been so important
in France, and which with and after Villemain took a new
colour; Planche, as the most noteworthy champion of the
other school (yet not so “other” but that the two interpenetrate
and overlap) of the critics who are purely men of letters, and
almost purely journalists; and Magnin for the pure scholars.
The rest, with one or two exceptions, but not excepting so
famous a man as Janin, will bear postponement, can even be
postponed with advantage. The chief exception is Mérimée;
here, as always, by the joint efforts of Fate and himself, alone.
But the great twin names of Michelet and Quinet may require
a little mention here, and before proceeding even to Hugo.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Michelet and Quinet.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These two inseparables—more inseparable even than the
other pair, Cousin and Villemain—must, I fear, be also among
those whom I shall seem to some readers to slight.
Both, but especially Quinet,<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c010'><sup>[609]</sup></a> were of course saturated
with literature. From his first translation of Herder to his
posthumous work on the Greek genius, Quinet was always
dealing with the subject, often <span lang="la"><i>nominatim</i></span>, seldom in very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>remote fashion. Michelet no doubt directed himself more to
the purely historical side of that historical study of humanity
which he learnt from Vico, and Quinet probably from Herder
himself. Literary citations, literary parallels, literary suggestions
swarm in Michelet; even the ’45 seems to him (the
origin of the notion is obvious enough, but thinking it out
will be found uncommonly difficult) “a Canto of <cite>Ossian</cite>.” But
for our purposes the pair are almost disqualified—Michelet
more than Quinet, but Quinet very mainly—by two things.
The first is that confusion—whither derived from Vico or
from the Germans does not matter—of literature with history,
sociology, politics, psychology, and the like, which has seemed
orthodox to the two last generations, but which to me appears
a dangerous delusion and confusion. The other is the peculiar
<span lang="fr"><i>voyant</i></span> thought and style of both, which precludes them from
taking anything like a clear and achromatic view of any literary
matter, even if they had endeavoured to do so. Not that the
prophet cannot be a critic, for we have been able to disentangle
some extremely clear, trenchant, and (however disputable)
orderly and logical dicta of criticism from Blake: and Carlyle’s
deficiencies, where he is deficient as a critic, do not at all
come from this cause. But maresnesting, and night-maresnesting
in special, is the very worst possible—perhaps one might
say the very most impossible—occupation for a critic; and
while Quinet was often, Michelet was almost always, in quest
of the variety and the sub-variety of nest.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hugo.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The temperament of Victor Hugo<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c010'><sup>[610]</sup></a> was perhaps as uncritical
a one as any man ever possessed, or as ever possessed any
man: but the strength of his genius was such that
it could hardly fail to confer mastery, at any rate
for a time, on its various literary applications. When the sins
of temperament had become besetting and habitual, and the
genius was—in this respect, not others—a little failed, his
criticism became scarcely more than a curiosity; when the genius
was still in its prime, and the temperament had not broken
through all control, it is sometimes of a very notable character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span><cite>William Shakespeare</cite><a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c010'><sup>[611]</sup></a> is the best text-book of the later and
worse state; the <cite>Prefaces</cite> to the <cite>Cromwell</cite>,<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c010'><sup>[612]</sup></a> to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Orientales</cite></span>,<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c010'><sup>[613]</sup></a>
and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Littérature et Philosophie Mêlées</cite></span><a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c010'><sup>[614]</sup></a> of the earlier and
better. To take the worst first, though there are fine things
in the <cite>Shakespeare</cite> book,—there could not fail to be, seeing
that it was written, <span lang="fr"><i>en regardant l’océan</i></span>, by Victor Hugo,—and
though a sort of <span lang="fr"><i>aura</i></span> of the right Romantic fury still
breathes through it, it has nothing of criticism except a
splendid concionatory harangue to admiration of the best
things, and a great deal of Hugonism nearly at its worst.
The colossal confidence in ignorance, which made the poet a
laughing-stock to his enemies, permits him to observe (in
arguing that England never knew her Shakespeare till Voltaire
taught her better) that Dryden <span lang="fr"><i>parla de S. une fois pour le
déclarer hors d’usage</i></span>. <a id='sec8.2.23'></a><span class='sni side7'>William Shakespeare.</span> It would be a good examination question,
“Translate into the French of Hugo ‘the largest
and most universal soul,’ &#38;c.,” and the dictionary
resulting would be quite a useful cipher-code.
Elsewhere you have the usual page-long strings of names,
the usual staccato sentences, punctuated with <span lang="fr"><i>nons</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>ouis</i></span>,
and stripped of articles and particles, the usual abuse of
England (whose life for one thing that she did, in giving
Victor Hugo refuge, he will yet not wholly take), and also
the usual bursts of verbal and imaginative inspiration which
give us the <span lang="fr"><i>petite fièvre cérébrale</i></span>, and make us excuse, forget,
welcome any nonsense, any bad taste, even any bad blood.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Littérature et Philosophie.</div>

<p class='c001'>Nothing that I have said, or shall say, is to be construed as
implying contempt of the remaining critical works of Hugo.
On the contrary, “Read all the Prefaces of <cite>Dryden</cite>,”
which Swift said in scorn, may be adapted here in
utter seriousness. And the student who wishes to
know must read the whole of <span lang="fr"><cite>Littérature et Philosophie Mêlées</cite></span>—that
curious collection of the poet’s critical and other work
from the age of seventeen to the age of thirty-two. The gods
do not grant to any man to be a good critic at seventeen; but
they do grant to a Victor Hugo not to be a negligible writer
at any time. In the “Journal of a Young Jacobite” of 1819;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>in the “Opinions of a Revolutionary” of 1830; in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Idées au
Hasard</cite></span>; above all, when the poet-critic was a little over age,
in the articles on Scott and Voltaire, on Lamennais and Byron,
on Mirabeau and Dovalle, there is matter which might have
made twenty critics; though it did not please the Fates that
it should actually make one. These things are a very open
allegory; there should not be any need, and there is certainly
here no space, to interpret them.<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c010'><sup>[615]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Cromwell <i>Preface,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If Victor Hugo had written no criticism but <cite>William Shakespeare</cite>,
I think I should have put him, as I have put Balzac,
in a note, and left him otherwise alone, out of
respect, not of persons, but of the divinity of
poetry. The two Prefaces that I have selected—there
are others, but these will suffice us—would have given
him a substantive place here, if he had written no poetry at
all. That to <cite>Cromwell</cite> is the longer, the more elaborate, and
much the more famous: but I do not think that it is really
quite so important as the later and shorter to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Orientales</cite></span>.
In the first, with a proud humility which retains a little more
of the noun, if it has not much less of the adjective, than the
undisguised arrogance of the later work, Hugo, while professing
not to defend himself at all, and to regard the Classic
<i>v.</i> Romantic debate as practically fought out and over, as a
fact fights the whole battle once more. It is observable that
the word “art,” without being made exactly the battle-cry,
recurs again and again throughout the piece, and is, in fact,
its dominant. But he has a theory of poetry, not so very
different in outline from that of the <span lang="fr">“Goliaths classiques,”</span> of
whom he affects not so much as to take notice. Man and
poetry woke in primitive times; when man is singing he is
close to God; and the rest of it. The voice is unmistakably
Hugo’s, but the forms of thought which it chooses might
almost be eighteenth, or even seventeenth, century. They
work out the conclusion that Epic + Lyric = Drama—the latter
being largely dealt with to show the rise of Comedy and the
dignity of the Grotesque. Already we get Hugo’s name-triads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>flung at us (to use one of his beloved Spanish comparisons)
like <span lang="es"><i>bolas</i></span>. There is a great deal about Shakespeare. The
“Two” Unities—Hugo has extended his grace to the original
one—of Time and Place are too absurd to be spoken of: but
they <em>are</em> spoken of and shown to be absurd. A passage on
rules, models, and imitations is perhaps the most effective of
the whole, though it comes the best part of a century after
Lessing. There is an excommunication of Delille (very interesting
to compare with the glorification by Joubert, whose
own theory of poetry fits Hugo as well, as it fits Delille, <em>to us</em>,
strangely), leading to some remarks on <cite>Cromwell</cite> itself, which
have but minor interest, and a notable conclusion on Criticism.
There is here more dignity than in those remarks in which he
was wont to indulge later, when he drew upon himself the
dignified reproof of M. Nisard: and they contain some really
good observation on False Taste, old and new, a well-founded
denunciation of critique by rule and kind, by faults and
beauties, and a final protest against mere Authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>The piece is of great interest even now: and one can readily
understand the immense influence it must have had as a
manifesto. But it is injured by its length, by its want of
method, and by the constant presence of the two dissonances
above indicated. That the poet should fight <span lang="la"><i>pro domo sua</i></span> is
natural, desirable, laudable: but why are we to be disturbed
by the constant assertion of a lofty indifference? It is again
natural, desirable, laudable, that he should fight the general
Romantic prize—there was every possible justification for it.
But why, again, the pretence of not troubling himself about
any such business, and of the business being really over?</p>

<a id='sec8.2.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and that to the</i> Orientales.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Preface to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Orientales</cite></span> escapes all these objections
and, short as it is, is undoubtedly the most remarkable piece
of criticism that Hugo has left, while it is also the
boldest, the clearest, the least hampered with tricks
and mannerisms, the most serious, the most really
dignified. In it he “goes straight for the jugular.”<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c010'><sup>[616]</sup></a> He
questions, and denies point-blank, the right of the critic to
interrogate the poet on his choice of subject or of treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span><em>at all</em>. <span lang="fr">“L’ouvrage est-il bon ou est-il mauvais: voilà tout
le domaine de la critique.”</span> Here we come again to one of
the epoch-making sentences, one of the great <span lang="fr"><i>jalons</i></span> of critical
history. No ancient had ever dared to say it. Patrizzi had
said it, hardly knowing what he had said. The German and
English Romantics had cast about it, implied it, made themselves
responsible for it, or something like it; but never posed
it plumply as the Charter of Literature. And Hugo does not
leave it as if he were afraid of it, or half-ignorant what it
means. He turns it over and over, so as at each turn to
give a fresh blow to the Neo-classics. Never mind the means
employed: ask <em>how</em> they are employed. There are no good
or bad subjects in poetry: there are only good or bad poets.
Everything is a subject. Poetry is a country of universal
suffrage: examine <em>how</em> the artist has worked, not <em>why</em>. Art
has nothing to do with gags, leading-strings, handcuffs: he
may go where he list, believe as he list, do what he lists.
Kind, story, space, time, fashion, all are at his choice.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then, amplifying more particularly the phrase about the
<em>limits</em> of art, Hugo has one of his most characteristic and finest
passages of exuberant prose, expressing the wish to make his
poetry like a Spanish city—half oriental, half mediæval—and
finishes very briefly with some words on his actual book.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Capital position of this latter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This is the real <span lang="fr"><i>clou</i></span>, the central decisive point of Hugonic,
and indeed of all Romantic, criticism. “Never mind the subject,
the kind, anything of that sort: is the treatment
good?” is practically the gospel of modern
as opposed to ancient, of Romantic as opposed to
Classical, criticism. Of course, like all hard-and-fast propositions
and prescriptions as to things that are not hard-and-fast,
and especially like all controversial propositions and aggressive
prescriptions of all kinds, it does not contain the whole truth,
and it does not even contain nothing but the truth. If it be
construed in the sense that one subject is as good as another,
it may, and probably will, lead wrong. If it be taken to mean
that even the experience of our two thousand five hundred
years (or whatever it is) of literature does not show that
some subjects are so much more difficult and thankless than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>others that they are <em>practically</em> impossible, it will entice the
poet to useless and probably dangerous experiment. But then,
with reasonable people, it does not mean either of these things.
It is in reality a defensive much more than an offensive proposition,—a
protest which must be allowed in any Court of
Historical Criticism against the Classic and especially the Neo-classic
notion of <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> classification of Subject and Kind,
and of referring to this instead of considering <em>the work</em> first.
<a id='sec8.2.28'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The</i> “work”.</span>I have known objection taken to the use—at least
the frequent use—of this word “work” in literature,
and as to literature. It is, in fact, something of a shibboleth:
but, I think, a valuable one. No one who uses it intelligently
is likely to forget that it is the <em>work</em>, the work<em>ing</em>, the art, not
the material, that he is to look to first. And Victor Hugo,
in the document before us, was practically the first to enjoin
this duty with authority and conviction.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may pass appropriately to his most distinguished opponent
and his most enthusiastic disciple in regard to this
gospel.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Nisard: his</i> Ægri Somnia.</div>

<p class='c001'>The memories of a reviewer, however hard he may have
tried to do his duty, are apt to lodge in a tomb from which
there grow more briers than roses. It is not the
most unpleasant of the thoughts of the present
writer on his own reviewing period that the <span lang="la"><i>Ægri
Somnia</i></span><a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c010'><sup>[617]</sup></a> of M. Désiré Nisard enabled him, not quite too late,
to revise, in the right direction, his opinion of their author.
There needed, and there needs, no grovelling palinode—Nisard
still seemed, and still seems to me, to have taken on the whole
the wrong side in criticism. And I am not quite certain that
the reproach (which was brought against him and which he
endeavoured to refute, almost as late as the publication of
<span lang="la"><i>Ægri Somnia</i></span> itself, by boldly and wisely reprinting his early
articles) of having “burnt what he had adored” was quite
unjust. But in these last utterances there was a singular
dignity, justice, and good taste, contrasting rather fortunately
or unfortunately, according to the side on which one looked,
with the insolences which Hugo had permitted himself during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the senile apotheosis of his fifteen years’ restoration after
the Année Terrible.  And one saw—as indeed one always
had seen more or less—that whatever had been faulty in M.
Nisard’s earlier, but not earliest judgments, had been the result
of an undue, an exclusive, a not quite intelligently catholic
devotion to justice, dignity, good taste.  There have been
greater men who had worse gods.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His</i> <span lang="fr">Essais sur le Romantisme</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>If one did not know how very differently personal matters
strike the person and the not-person, it might be surprising
to a reader of the reprinted <span lang="fr"><cite>Essais sur le Romantisme</cite></span><a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c010'><sup>[618]</sup></a>
that M. Nisard should have in any way complained
of the charge of burning what he had
adored. The first half of the book is occupied with articles
dating from 1829 to 1831—on Hugo, Vigny, Sainte-Beuve,
Lamartine, and even Musset.  They are very good articles;
they are, I think, better criticism than Sainte-Beuve’s own
was at this time: but, though they are not wildly ultra-Romantic,
they in each and every case—even in that of Musset
himself—take the side and the defence of the innovators.  It
is true that there is, towards the last, a momentous and
germinal doubt whether there is not something <em>excessive</em> in
Hugo—whether there is not <span lang="fr"><i>de trop</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>And in the Preface to the second part, written in 1838,
the critic announces his conversion in terms which admit of
no dispute.  He speaks of his <span lang="fr"><i>retour aux doctrines classiques</i></span>,
he says that he has “ranged himself,” that he “climbs back,
with discouraged and dragging step, the road that he had run
down in his intoxication.”  Metaphor for metaphor, has this
much change to give or to receive from that of “burning the
adored”?  And the substance of the remainder bears this out.
Much in the manifesto <span lang="fr"><cite>Contre la Littérature Facile</cite></span> is quite
true—not merely of 1830: and the subsequent controversy
with Jules Janin is not idle or one-sided.  But as for the
articles on Hugo himself which follow, an innocent person
might suppose them to have been written by quite another
M. Nisard than the author of those above referred to.  The
<span lang="fr"><cite>Chants du Crépuscule</cite></span>, we are told, <span lang="fr"><span lang="fr">“ont achevé de désespérer les
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>amis de M. V. H.”</span></span>  (They contain, let it be remembered,
<em>Napoleon II</em>.) There is a <span lang="fr"><i>caractère de décadence</i></span> in them.  His
prose has a better chance than his verse.  His <span lang="fr"><i>mort littéraire</i></span>
is <span lang="fr"><i>prochaine</i></span> (so near, in fact, that he wrote the <span lang="fr"><cite>Légende des
Siècles</cite></span> twenty, and published the <span lang="fr"><cite>Quatre Vents de l’Esprit</cite></span>
more than forty years later).</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes!  M. Nisard was burning what he had adored; but it is
fair to admit that for the rest of his long life he adored what
he had certainly never burned.  His most famous work, the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de la Littérature Française</cite></span>,<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c010'><sup>[619]</sup></a> is written in rigid confinement
to the Classical house, with fresh windows opened,
indeed, so that the critic could see the glory of Shakespeare
and others outside, but with a strict regulation that nothing
shall be changed in the furniture and regulations within.  The
capital studies of Latin Poets, the miscellaneous literary work—professorial
and other—are all the consistent utterances of a
man who has pulled himself up on the edge (or a little over
the edge) of a precipice, and has resolved, for the rest of his
life, to walk steadily in the other direction.  No article of
Sainte-Beuve’s is at once juster and more acute than that on
M. Nisard’s <span lang="fr"><cite>History</cite></span>, with its exposition of the way in which
the critic-historian has constructed an <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> theory of the
French literary genius, and has written his history accordingly—accepting
and eulogising those writers who illustrate his
conception, neglecting or denouncing those who run counter to
it.  And the conception itself is formed altogether according to
the second manner of viewing—the view according to which <span lang="fr"><cite>Les
Chants du Crépuscule</cite></span> is, in another sense, a song of approaching
night.  M. Nisard tells us that his conversion was effected
during a visit to England, and under the influence of Homer
and La Fontaine.  Surely never was there such a singular
instance of <span lang="la"><i>similia similibus</i></span> in literature; nor has the country
of Shakespeare—where, by the way, Tennyson and Browning
had just brought out their first books—ever exercised a more
remarkable influence upon a studious visitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>By whatever process, M. Nisard had become a confirmed
anti-Romantic, and such he remained to the end.  He is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>of the best of the breed: learned, consistent, courageous,
courteous withal, as the critic who is or wishes to be considered
“scholarly” too seldom is.  But he has given himself
up to an idol: he will not take the Work as the Work presents
itself, and judge whether it is good or bad.  And the
result is inevitable.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their</i> <span lang="la">culpa maxima</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The conclusion of the reprinted <span lang="fr"><cite>Essais</cite></span>, with great temper
and in excellent taste, practically confesses M. Nisard’s weakness
as a critic.  It is the weakness of the old
“faults-and-beauties” method, joined to the moral
heresy.  Victor Hugo, he says, was a man with very grave
moral faults.  He was: and what is more, these moral faults
were of a singularly disenchanting kind.  Further, Victor
Hugo’s works are full of faults not merely moral.  They are:
and sometimes these faults are almost inconceivable.  But
what M. Nisard forgot is that the critic, like the miner, is
finally concerned with the quantity and quality of poetic gold
which a poet—or, for the matter of that, with the quantity and
quality of literary gold which any man of letters—will yield.
No matter that it lies in a pestilential neighbourhood; no
matter that you have to smelt out quartz, and far worse and
uglier things than quartz, to get it.  Is the gold there?  That,
and nothing else, is the question.  Now, in Hugo the gold is
there; it is there not by pennyweights, not by ounces, not by
pounds, but by hundredweights to the ton.  And the critical
process, if only it be perfected, is after all not so laborious as
the process of stamps and cyanide; the critic himself is not
susceptible to wild beasts and malaria.  Gold or no gold? much
gold or little? these are his true questions.  M. Nisard could
not see them.  The gold must be ready smelted to a certain
orthodox French standard; it must be even brought in ingots,
or ready worked into jewellery, according to pattern.  Otherwise
he would not have it.  And of the many critics that have
been, are, will be, like unto him, he was after all one of the
best.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Gautier.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>France—I have been told frequently of late, and even not
so very late, years—has forgotten her Théophile Gautier.  And
some of the voices have generally said that she has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>quite right in doing so, whether urged to the forgetfulness
by serious arguments such as those of M. Émile
Faguet (whom, though I differ with him not seldom,
I desire to take the opportunity here of saluting with all
possible respect as an admirable critic, and to whom I could
almost pay the doubtful compliment of wishing that he were
dead in order that I might discuss him fully), or by the mere
impertinences of quite trivial folk. I have never seen the least
reason to change my own opinion to the contrary, that “Théo”
was not only one of the most amiable and (with some peccadillos)
estimable men of letters of the whole French century,
but one of the greatest of its men of letters in verse and in
prose, in romance and in travel-writing, in miscellanies and
in criticism. He was not greatest in the function which here
concerns us, but he was great. The common complaint that
he was too good-natured, though it may have some faint colour,
is mainly a blunder and the son of a blunder—that is to say,
of the notion, far too often encouraged by critics themselves,
that the critic is a schoolmaster, whose business is to say
nothing but “Blockhead!” and “Sit down!” and “Come to
me after school!” But the comparative ill-luck which
pursued him, and forced him always to write for bread, partly
turned him away from pure literary criticism,<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c010'><sup>[620]</sup></a> and sometimes
made him write smooth but not very significant things
to please, though never at the cost of friendship and principle.
Much that he wrote is not reprinted; he could not afford,
like M. de Pontmartin, for instance, to “embook” all his
<span lang="fr"><i>feuilletons</i></span>. Yet certain volumes of his printed works, the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Grotesques</cite></span>, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire du Romantisme</cite></span>, and its companion the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span>, with some separate articles, prefaces,
&#38;c., will give us good matter to indite of.<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c010'><sup>[621]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His theory: “Art for Art’s sake,” &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“Théo” has not been a favourite with the grave and precise
sort among our fellowship as a rule: yet, if they could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>be consistent, they should at least admire him for his own
consistency, and for the fact that, from the very
first to the very last, his criticism, apparently
so impressionist and occasional, was conducted on
an almost rigid—on a quite logical and well
co-ordinated—theory. This theory was the famous one of
“L’Art pour l’Art,” with, for inseparable companion, the
doctrine that <em>the</em> instrument, <em>the</em> medium, <em>the</em> vehicle, almost
<em>the</em> constituent of literary art, is the Word, the beautiful
word, furnished with its beauty by light and colour, by sound
and form, and developing it by skilful and laborious arrangement,
selection, and rejection. As for the major theory (the
formulation of which is sometimes attributed to Hugo himself,
and was admitted by him as late as <cite>William Shakespeare</cite>,
but with an important qualification, and even, to a
certain extent, disclaimer, as to its range and meaning) I
have already said,<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c010'><sup>[622]</sup></a> though I see that some critics have not
observed the observation, that, especially with the addition
“Art for Art’s sake <em>only</em>,” it is at best but a half truth,
and may be a full half “error and curse.” And we all
know to what sort of whole a half truth constantly turns.
Art, after all, is a <em>means</em>: and “means for means’ sake
only,” if not nonsense, is at any rate sense very incomplete.
But it was necessary, and it was almost desirable, that the
exaggeration should be formulated, because of the incessant
intrusion of the opposite theories, which are scarcely even
<em>quarter</em>-truths, that all depends on the subject, that art must
serve morality, and the like. As for the second doctrine
above formulated, I need not say that, with Longinus and
with Dante, I accept it absolutely and <span lang="fr"><i>sans phrase</i></span>. To both
doctrines, however, to the more disputable as to the less,
Gautier flew at first, and clung at last, not more in the provocative
youthfulness of the Preface to <span lang="fr"><cite>Mademoiselle de Maupin</cite></span>
than in the famous and exquisite</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and writing, more than as many years later still. The first
is an eager and passionate sermon on the doctrine by a fervent
neophyte; the second, its mature embodiment in imperishable
verse by a master. Both together leave very little to be said
on the matter save the single word “Read!”</p>

<a id='sec8.2.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His practice</i>: <span lang="fr">Les Grotesques</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, what has to be said on them by way of comment
belongs rather to Interchapter and Conclusion than to this
place, where we are busy with Gautier’s application
of his doctrines. The next considerable document
to the Preface just noticed is the <span lang="fr"><cite>Grotesques</cite></span> of 1844,
a delightful book. After all that has been written since on
Villon, one comes back to it about him. Scalion de Virbluneau
and some others are mere <span lang="fr"><i>hors-d'œuvre</i></span>, agreeable enough, but
no more. The <span lang="fr"><i>pièce de résistance</i></span> of the book is the long, ardent,
but at the same time humorous (Théo was one of the few
indubitable humourists that France can boast) vindication of
the critic’s namesake, Théophile de Viaud, one of the most
luckless of the many luckless poets of genius. But Saint-Amant,
Chapelain, Scudéry, Scarron, supply him with occasions
for work scarcely inferior to the <span lang="fr">“Théophile.”</span> The criticism
is of course, on the whole, avowedly criticism of the lighter
kind, gossip-criticism, criticism intended not to disgust those
who do not take literature very seriously. But it is also intended
to please those who do: and it does.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Histoire du Romantisme, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The various documents included under the general head of
<span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire du Romantisme</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span> are of
very different dates, covering nearly the whole of
Gautier’s forty years of literary life. Being ranged
rather by subject than by date,<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c010'><sup>[623]</sup></a> they enable us
to judge the singular evenness and continuity of his critical
spirit, which (as Maxime Du Camp, I think, has urged, and
as I myself have always held) was systematic by tendency and
nature, though haphazard on the surface. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire</cite></span> itself
was actually interrupted by the critic-poet’s death: and the
masterly Essay on the French Poetry of the middle of the
Century (which should be compared with Sainte-Beuve’s)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>is only five years before it: but some of its companions go
back twenty years, and many of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span>
recede to the legendary decade of the ’Thirties themselves.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Ubiquity of felicity in his criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In all, the same critical qualities are apparent—a central
motive and directing power of belief in the two doctrines
stated above, but at the same time a system of
gearing, flexible enough to accommodate itself to
the most widely different subjects, an unwearied
and rejoicing faculty of appreciation proper, an unrivalled
science of verse and of descriptive and decorative prose, an ever-present
charm, and, over all and through all, the atmosphere of
the sweet and sunny temper which it is so specially delightful
and so rare to find in a competent critic. But for those who
want sufficient yet not too copious examples, three long pieces—the
article on French Poetry above mentioned, the <span lang="fr">“Balzac”</span> of
1858 (which M. Montégut, I think, has justly called <span lang="fr"><i>magnifique</i></span>),
and the Introduction to the posthumous edition of Baudelaire
in 1867—will do excellently. Between them they would fill a
not so very small volume, and there would be hardly a page in
that volume destitute of the merits just enumerated, and others
to boot.  The first is perhaps the greatest example extant of
reviewing, brought <span lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span>, and made really higher
criticism. From the <span lang="fr"><cite>Légende des Siècles</cite></span> (and remember what
Gautier writing on Hugo meant under the Second Empire!)
to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Odes Funambulesques</cite></span>, from <span lang="fr"><cite>Poèmes Evangéliques</cite></span> to <span lang="fr"><cite>Fleurs
du Mal</cite></span>, on scores of poets and books of poetry besides, he finds
always the suitable, and, at the same time, always the admirable
word to say. On Balzac and Baudelaire alike—great as is the
alteration of palette, and viewing-glass, and style of handling
that the two require—he shows alike that “impeccability,”
that “perfect magic in letters,” which the younger of his subjects
had ascribed to him. I do not know any critic who deserves
the older and now strangely altered epithet of “candid” (<i>i.e.</i>,
“<em>amiably</em> just”) better than Gautier: but his amiability is
never indulged at the expense of his justice. And perhaps it
needs nothing more than the statement of this fact to express,
συνετοῖσι, the infinite resources of his skill in thought and
phrase.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span></div>
<a id='sec8.2.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Saint-Marc Giradin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Saint-Marc Girardin<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c010'><sup>[624]</sup></a> (who was three or four years older
than Sainte-Beuve, and outlived him by four or five) has, in
a reference above, been coupled with Villemain, and
the resemblance both of career and of critical quality
is rather strong. Both were politicians, both professors, and
both played their double part after a fashion to which there are
few parallels in English history, and those few not very
encouraging. But Saint-Marc Girardin was a really considerable
person in politics—not least in the very last days of his
life, when, in the National Assembly, charged with the reconstitution
of France after the Prussian War, he was a strong
monarchical and Orleanist partisan. Of his numerous works,
our chief texts are his <span lang="fr"><cite>Cours de Littérature Dramatique</cite></span> and his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Essais de Littérature et de Morale</cite></span> which appeared in succession<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c010'><sup>[625]</sup></a>
about the middle of the fifth decade of the nineteenth century.
It may be well to say frankly and plumply that he is one of
our (or perhaps it were better not to avoid the <span lang="fr"><i>moi haïssable</i></span>,
and say “my”) disappointments. I did not read him very
early, and had a very fair conceit of him when I began: but
I find little to recommend in him.<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c010'><sup>[626]</sup></a> He is emphatically
“clever”; must have been a stimulating and effectual professor;
writes very well; has a real (and not, as is rather common, a
painfully simulated) combination of the man of letters and the
man of the world. But he does not give me the idea of having
had any spontaneous, individual, love for literature, or any
original personal views about it. He has everywhere the <span lang="fr"><i>juste
milieu</i></span>, the opportunism of his time, and his party, and his
profession. He is neither a <span lang="fr"><i>perruque</i></span> nor an <span lang="fr"><i>échevelé</i></span>: he is, in
fact, an accomplished Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans.
And Time is terribly of the Divine mind as to Laodicea and
its angels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, his method of dealing with Literature, and
especially with that dramatic literature which chiefly interested
him, is of the kind from which, as it seems to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>there come few good things—<span lang="fr">“De l’Amour Conjugal chez
Shakespeare,” “Le Mariage au Théâtre dans Molière,” “La
Jalousie”</span> in this, that, and the other. It may be because
of that “barrenness in the philosophic” with which I have
been charged; but these things seem to me to be learning’s
labour lost. Study Othello, study Leontes, study Posthumus
as much as you like; but to see the life, the poetry, the
passion in these live, poetic, passionate men and plays, not
to extract a dead essence in a bottle and label it “Jealousy
in Shakespeare”—or rather <span lang="la"><i>in vacuo</i></span>. Still, there are others
who have other tastes, and Saint-Marc Girardin’s half score of
editions prove it, and perhaps justify them.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Planche.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Gustave Planche, on the other hand—a critic probably much
less known now, except vaguely and anecdotically, than Girardin—appears
to me to have been a real critic, and to
have missed, so narrowly that I do not quite know
<em>how</em> he missed it, being a very great critic. Probably it was
<span lang="la"><i>quia non multum amabat</i></span>: because he succumbed to that
fatalest temptation of our kind to scratch and scoff and
snarl instead of embracing. Anecdotically, as I have said,
he is probably well enough known—his passion for George
Sand, and his odd ways, and especially that most unlucky
indifference to clean linen, and cleanliness generally, which he
shared with the authors of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Song to David</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Rambler</cite></span>,
turn up in all the books. He appears in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Comédie
Humaine</cite></span>,<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c010'><sup>[627]</sup></a> and the more extreme Hugolaters shudder or storm
at him as a blasphemer of Hugo. But I rather doubt whether
many people read his criticism now.<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c010'><sup>[628]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.2.39'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Weight of his criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet it deserves reading thoroughly: and it is only a pity
that there is not more of it easily accessible. That Planche
entirely avoids the quest of the mare’s-nest cannot
be said; but some varieties of that curious structure
are very tempting even to good critics. He may be thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>to have found or built a famous one in the discovery that
the three egregious books of the excellent Henry Mackenzie,
instead of being Sterne <em>plus</em> Rousseau, watered down with <em>quant.
suff.</em> of artificial tears, are “a sorrowful and unique hymn on
the insufficiency and obscurity of actual life,” the “confession of
an immaculate soul.” One thinks of the entire pressgang lifting
up its voice and weeping at the noble conduct of old
Edwards, and the like, and one marvels—but not, in my
case at least, contemptuously. It is perhaps not wonderful,
after this, that Planche, though he admires Fielding, cannot
tolerate <cite>Jonathan Wild</cite>. Yet in close context he gives us taste
of his quality by a really admirable inquiry—one of the best
I know—into the difference of Drama and Novel, and the light
which is thrown by and on this difference, in regard to the
inferiority of Fielding as a dramatist, and his greatness in
prose fiction. No one who has been so kind as to interest
himself in my views will think that I agree with Planche
when he holds that “literary quality does not matter,” when
he bids us seek “the will before the inspiration, the fatal
irresistible <em>idea</em>.” He would certainly have anathematised,
and does, I think, somewhere very nearly anathematise in
terms, my favourite doctrine of the Poetic Moment. But
what do such differences of opinion matter? You blaze away
at the enemy, but, if he and you be of the right stamp, you
salute the soldier.</p>

<p class='c001'>And Planche (for all his most unfortunate objection to soap
and water) is, I think, a “gentleman of the French Guard,”
a <cite>Black Mousquetaire</cite> of the doughtiest. His objection to Hugo<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c010'><sup>[629]</sup></a>
is not in the least fossil or stupid. He has a right to it: it
is a legitimate and inevitable deduction from his general poetic
creed and likings. No poet gives more “poetic moments” than
Hugo: and Planche, as we have seen, does not hold with them.
No poet has more of <span lang="fr"><i>poésie visible</i></span> than Hugo: and Planche
objects to this poetry <span lang="la"><i>nominatim</i></span>, directly, again and again, and
wants to go back to that <span lang="fr"><i>poésie intelligible</i></span>, in which, it must
be admitted, Victor would not be quite so victorious. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>argues—and I do not know that one can so easily deny it
off-hand as point out that it is a dangerous suggestion of
false issues—that beauty of form does sometimes “appeal to
the very lowest passions”: while, on the other hand, a poet
<span lang="fr"><i>doit toujours avoir une idée philosophique</i></span>, which (again we
must confess) Hugo very seldom, if ever, had. Yet for all this
he can say plumply, <span lang="fr"><i>pour le maniement de la langue, M. Hugo
n’a pas de rival</i></span>, and he admires, little as he can have agreed
with much of it, that remarkable Preface to <span lang="fr"><cite>Littérature et
Philosophie Mélées</cite></span> on which we have commented above.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is nothing if not a daring critic. Some of us, who have
studied French Literature very long, would hesitate to tell
a Frenchman, as Planche unhesitatingly tells Bulwer,<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c010'><sup>[630]</sup></a> not
merely that he ought to be <span lang="fr"><i>plus serré, plus précis, et moins
vague</i></span>, which is true and within any one’s competence, but
<span lang="fr"><i>moins incorrect</i></span>, which from a foreigner seems going far. This
<em>verbality</em> of Planche’s is in fact one of his main notes.  Lamartine,<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c010'><sup>[631]</sup></a>
one might think, was made for him as a poet: and
he does indeed think that Lamartine’s position is <span lang="fr"><i>magnifique
et incontesté</i></span>. But he does not scruple to say that <span lang="fr"><i>la grammaire
est souvent offensée</i></span> by the poet of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Méditations</cite></span>; that <span lang="fr"><i>l’indicatif
se croise avec l’imparfait</i></span> (think of the horror of this crime!)
<span lang="fr"><i>à trois lignes de distance</i></span>; that the ambitious <span lang="fr"><cite>Jocelyn</cite></span> is <span lang="fr"><i>un
beau poème sans composition et sans style</i></span>. It may be more
surprising that he is not cordial to Alfred de Vigny, and
cannot in the least grasp <span lang="fr"><cite>Dolorida</cite></span>: but it must be remembered
that Vigny’s earlier work (the posthumous Poems might have
pleased Planche better, had he lived to see them) is distinctly
inclined to that <span lang="fr"><i>poésie visible</i></span>, which the critic did not like
because, I think, he could not himself “see” it. It must be
admitted that he “gets home” on Leconte de Lisle’s Wardour
Street Greek—though I do not know that his sharp correction
is more fatal than “Théo’s” mild one.<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c010'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, we may mention the extremely remarkable paper<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c010'><sup>[633]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>on <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Royautés Littéraires</cite></span>, with its notable classification of
critics into those who gauge works of literature (1) by comparing
them with the past, (2) as present things merely, (3) by
looking to the future and the end that the author proposes
to himself. Here it is enough to point out to the intelligent
the curious difference between this classification and some
others. For Planche, near as his terms may seem to come
to it, does <em>not</em> mean, by the criticism of his first class, what
we mean by the Historic-Comparative method.</p>

<p class='c001'>These specimens will, I hope, for all their scrappiness and
want of context, give some idea of the force, weight, acuteness,
and intellectual moment of Planche’s criticism. It is not in
merely accidental and catalogue fashion that I have put him
next to Saint-Marc Girardin. There is a real and a vital contrast.
Planche may be right or he may be wrong, but what
he says is coherent; it comes from a direct and real examination,
intensely interested, of the subject under discussion; it is
guided by and supplemented from a body of definite and, to
some extent at any rate, reasoned literary preferences and
principles. In short, once more, the live contact, the true,
fruitful, critical embrace. It is a pity he did not wash!</p>

<a id='sec8.2.40'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Magnin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of Magnin we need not say so much, but all that is said must
be good. A librarian for many, and a professor for a few, years,
he was, as we have called him, a pure scholar, but
with his erudition mellowed and sweetened by
literature. His <span lang="fr"><cite>Origines du Théâtre en Europe</cite></span>,<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c010'><sup>[634]</sup></a> written in the
early days of historical comparative study of mediæval literature,
is a classic still: and his <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries et Méditations</cite></span><a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c010'><sup>[635]</sup></a> contain
many things worth reading. He was much interested,
as were so many Frenchmen, by the visit of the English company
of actors, in which Miss Smithson was leading lady, to
Paris: and he was led to study the older English theatre,
though he misjudges <cite>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</cite>, and
rather staggers one’s notion of the necessary acquaintance
with the language of the literature you are criticising, by
talking about an English poem entitled “<em>The</em> Greece” (not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>“<span lang="fr"><i>La Grèce</i></span>,” understand). But probably we all do things as
bad or worse. And at any rate, Magnin, with this work, his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Origines</cite></span>, the re-introduction of modern readers to Hroswitha,<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c010'><sup>[636]</sup></a>
and other things, is a protagonist of the historical and the
comparative in the study of literature.</p>

<a id='sec8.2.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Mérimée.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As we separated Beyle in a former chapter, so we may
separate Beyle’s “most remarkable production,” Mérimée,<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c010'><sup>[637]</sup></a> in
this. His temperament, the very opposite in all
ways to Hugo’s, was as critical as Hugo’s was uncritical,
and his exquisite style—in some respects the most exquisite
of the French nineteenth century—should have lent
itself to criticism with a sort of pre-established harmony that
could never have belonged to the merely plain, or to the mainly
“fulgurous.” But, as in other ways, there was something
suicidal, or at least self-silencing, in this same temperament,
and Mérimée has not left us very much to deal with here.
There are numerous strokes of it in the <cite>Letters</cite> to Panizzi and
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Inconnues</cite></span>, some of them not unprecious. We knew that
Mérimée (ii. 205, to <em>the</em> Inconnue) would think Hugo “words
without ideas,” and recommend a dose of Madame de Sévigné
as a remedy (why not enjoy both and turn them to profit?).
But it is really interesting to find that he cannot like Baudelaire,
and most of all to find his first (though even then rather lukewarm)
approval of Renan as a brother in freethought lessening,
till we have the famous description—worthy of a Veuillot
who should cease to be a swashbuckler and become a gentleman
of the sword—of the style of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Vie de Jésus</cite></span> as “the
delight of all the servant-girls of France.” But Mérimée, like
some others whom we have noticed, was drawn away by his
studies, no less than by those contradictions of cynical-sentimental
temperament of which we have spoken, from pure
literary criticism to things like History and Antiquities, where
he had not to “distrust himself.” There may even have been
some of the Congrevian affectation, which Voltaire not unjustly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>rebuked, in the caprice which made him, as M. Blaze de Bury<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c010'><sup>[638]</sup></a>
says, <span lang="fr">“causeur, érudit, archéologue, académicien, sénateur, tout
ce qu’on voulait, mais homme de lettres! jamais!”</span> which
brought it about that <span lang="fr">“avec lui la littérature ne venait que
par surcroît.”</span> In his published things of the kind, <span lang="fr"><cite>Mélanges
Historiques et Littéraires</cite></span>,<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c010'><sup>[639]</sup></a> <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Historiques et Littéraires</cite></span>,<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c010'><sup>[640]</sup></a>
and the like, the literary side is studiously kept down and away
from, though, as we see from the <cite>Letters</cite>, it was always really
present. He imputes to Beyle<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c010'><sup>[641]</sup></a> his own assumed detachment
from it; the review<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c010'><sup>[642]</sup></a> of Ticknor’s <cite>Spanish Literature</cite>, which he
was so admirably qualified to write, is full of traits going in
the same direction. One is rather sorry to find Mérimée siding
with those who would have mediocre authors kept out of
literary histories, pretending that a man may read too much
(he was himself almost omnilegent), that you can understand
French seventeenth-century theatre (you cannot) “without
having read Campistron.” But this is the fanfaronade of a
modern Signor Pococurante, with a difference; and in the
piece Mérimée cannot help showing his own critical sense
(whether consistently or not) in his demand for more on the
early literature, in his contempt of symbolic and Germanising
explanations of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>. Of the two papers<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c010'><sup>[643]</sup></a> which, with
the “Beyle,” are the longest of his literary essays, the “Cervantes”
and the <span lang="fr">“Brantôme,”</span> the latter has a mere <span lang="la"><i>coda</i></span>, the
briefest possible, of true literary criticism, and the former not
very much of it. Even on his beloved Russians, Gogol,<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c010'><sup>[644]</sup></a>
Pouchkine, Tourguénieff—though there was bound to be more
here in the case of an actual Introduction, so to say, at last
by a Grand Master of the Ceremonies of a new language and
literature—there is hardly so much, except perhaps on Pouchkine,
as we should expect. Like Lockhart, to whom he
had a great resemblance, Mérimée hated “your d—d literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>man” so much, and feared so much to be mistaken for such a
person, that he would not, perhaps at last could not, be what
he might have been as a critic. But we could not do without
the stories from <cite>Charles IX.</cite> to <cite>Lokis</cite>, and we can very well do
without criticism from him. So all, once more, is for the best—a
reflection which, when made in connection with Mérimée,
has unwonted piquancy.</p>

<hr class='c024'>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r565'>565</a>. His <span lang="fr"><cite>Critiques et Études Littéraires</cite></span>
(2 vols., Paris, 1857) contain many
things upon which I should like to
dwell, especially his discussion, in the
<cite>Globe</cite>, of the <span lang="fr"><cite>État de la Poésie Française</cite></span>
in 1825. It is as good an expression
of the views of the earlier, cooler, and
more erudite Eclectic-Romantics as
could be wished.</p>

The <span lang="fr"><cite>Essais Philosophiques et Littéraires</cite></span>
(Paris, 1875) may also be consulted:
but, as the double titles may warn
the wary, there is not much pure
literature in either.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f567'>

<div class='footnote' id='f568'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r568'>568</a>. This, with Quintus Smyrnæus as
make-weight, is a sort of wreckage or
recovery from the lectures which were
howled down at the Collége de France
by anti-Imperialist students. It is the
largest of its author’s classical studies:
not perhaps the most interesting. The
French professorial method, possibly
in direct tradition from the time when
authors were really (and in some cases
almost merely) <em>read</em> to students, seems
to include a very large amount of
simple abstract and “argument.”
(“Priam conducts the young princess
to the Palace: he honours her,” &#38;c.)
This is, from our point of view, rather
surplusage, and at any rate more
important on Quintus Smyrnæus than
on Virgil. But we may note a
reference (p. 73) to Mr Arnold’s
<cite>Preface</cite>, then pretty new, which is an
interesting thing.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f569'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r569'>569</a>. There is naturally not much criticism
here except the remark—in itself
involving one of the few great commandments
of criticism and one of the
most frequently neglected—<span lang="fr">“il n’avait
pas assez <em>lu</em>.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f570'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r570'>570</a>. In the case of a man who wrote
so much and so often on the same
things as Sainte-Beuve, an exhaustive
general index would be a great assistance.
There is a whole volume
of <cite>Table</cite> to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries</cite></span>, properly so
called, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits de Femmes</cite></span>, and
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Littéraires</cite></span>; while the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Premiers Lundis</cite></span> contains a succinct
but very useful synopsis-index of all
the works and substantive pieces, and
<span lang="fr"><cite>Port-Royal</cite></span> has an elaborate index of
its own. But my copies of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits
Contemporains</cite></span> (5 vols.) and the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Chateaubriand</cite></span> (2), as well as the 13 of
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouveaux Lundis</cite></span>, are indexless.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f571'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r571'>571</a>. Sainte-Beuve <em>could</em> be dull, and
his Senate speeches are most painful
proofs of it. We know that the
Senators who talked him inaudible
had other reasons for their rudeness:
but he almost provoked it apart from
those reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f572'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r572'>572</a>. I know Balzac’s criticism, which is
extensive, pretty well: but I shall
do no such despite to his genius as to
allow him to appear here in a character
where he showed no genius at all.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f573'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r573'>573</a>. Paris, 1828, and since.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f574'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r574'>574</a>. This, however (5 vols., 1832-39),
was probably the first collection that
definitely announced its author to the
world at large.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f575'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r575'>575</a>. The first reissue (1844 ?) was only
in two.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f576'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r576'>576</a>. This is a crucial example. Sainte-Beuve
had a just reverence for the
powers of this Abdiel-Michael of aristocracy.
He even seems a little
daunted and dazzled by their sombre
splendour. But he does not bring
out their literary <em>quality</em> as he would
have done later.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f577'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r577'>577</a>. I believe this charming book—made
accessible for a time by the
Brussels reprint of 1868—is again very
rare. I once had the pleasure of introducing
it to the late Lord Houghton,
who told me afterwards that he had
bought it “and dressed it up all in
moons and stars.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f578'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r578'>578</a>. Vigny (in a passage which Sainte-Beuve
himself quotes with singular
blindness or singular boldness) puts
the thing finally: <span lang="fr"><i>Il ne faut disséquer
que les morts: cette manière de chercher
à ouvrir le cerveau d’un vivant est fausse
et mauvaise</i></span> (A. de. V.'s <span lang="fr"><cite>Journal</cite></span>, quoted
in <span lang="fr"><cite>Port. Contemp.</cite></span>, final ed., ii. 79).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f579'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r579'>579</a>. And, after all, let us remember
that, on the testimony of the Goncourts
(<cite>Journal</cite>, ii. 123), who have left some
of the most offensive things against
Sainte-Beuve, the critic, as late as 1863,
rebuked Taine for belittling Hugo, in
these memorable words, <span lang="fr">“Ne parlez
pas d’Hugo. Vous ne le connaissez
pas. Mais l'œuvre d’Hugo est magnifique!”</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f580'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r580'>580</a>. See for instance the opening (1832)
of the “Lamartine” (i. 276).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f581'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r581'>581</a>. <i>E.g.</i>, to Crabbe, pp. 328-330; to
Wordsworth and Coleridge, pp. 337-345.
Sainte-Beuve, it is hardly necessary
to say, was English of the quarter-blood.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f582'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r582'>582</a>. The not quite “single speech”

<div class='footnote' id='f583'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r583'>583</a>. This contains the admirable, if in
more than one sense generous, judgment
of Schlegel (Wilhelm), that he
<span lang="fr"><i>a eu l'œil à toutes les grandes choses littéraires,
s’il n’a pas toujour rendu justice
aux moyennes</i></span>.  Omit <span lang="fr"><i>grandes</i></span> in
the first clause; substitute it for
<span lang="fr"><i>moyennes</i></span> and prefix <span lang="fr"><i>pleine</i></span> to <span lang="fr"><i>justice</i></span> in
the second; and the thing becomes a
fair verdict on Sainte-Beuve himself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f584'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r584'>584</a>. One of Sainte-Beuve’s defects (“for
the man was mortal”) was an insufficient
appreciation of the grotesque
and the out-of-the-way.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f585'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r585'>585</a>. He himself put it earlier—at 1840
or thereabouts. No doubt, as I have
said above, the essays of the ’Forties
as a whole do show a great advance.
But I hardly recognise the full Sainte-Beuve
before, say, the “Daunou” and
the “Leopardi” of 1844.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f586'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r586'>586</a>. The definitive edition was published
in 1867-71 (the author died
midway in 1869), in 7 vols.—6 of text,
the first 5 of which average 600 pp.
each, 1 of elaborate index, by that
admirable student of the older French
literature, M. de Montaiglon. The

<p class='c001'><a href='#r599'>599</a>. I wonder whether Mr Arnold got
“Stagirius” from Sainte-Beuve, or direct
from Saint-Marc Girardin, who
seems to have extracted him originally
from the Golden-mouth? So,
too, did <cite>Sohrab and Rustum</cite> come from
the “Firdousi” article? These interesting
suggestions of suggestion—as
interesting as the ordinary plagiarism
and  parallel-passage inquiries of bad
and dull critics, are dull and bad—occur
with Sainte-Beuve more often
than with almost any man.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a difficulty in writing about German criticism,
especially in the great period of Goethe’s productiveness, which
hardly occurs in any other department of our subject. Not
only is there much positive critical writing from all the writers,
great and small, of the time, but almost all the writings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>the great ones are criticism of an indirect and applied kind.
The whole of German Literature from 1750 to 1830 is a sort
of <cite>Seminar</cite>—a kind of enormous and multifarious Higher Education
movement, pursued, with much more than half consciousness,
by persons often of great talent and sometimes of great
genius. To give an account of all this is impossible: if it were
possible it would be really improper, because much of what
the Germans found out with infinite labour was only what
nations more fortunately situated in regard to literary position
had inherited, if they sometimes neglected their inheritance.
But they also found out certain things which other nations
had not: nor is it easy to combine an indication of these
with an account, full, but not too full, of the entire movement;
and hardly any two persons are likely to agree on
the point where fulness is reached but running over has not
begun.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.1'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Hamann.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>An early and remarkable instance of this critical permeation
is Hamann,<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c010'><sup>[645]</sup></a> the “Magus of the North.” If Hamann had been
anything but a German, superficial readers might
take him for a quack; indeed, as it is, they have
done so, and possibly may still do so. After an early visit to
England—which was anything but fortunate, save that it
imbued him with English literature—and after trying various
occupations, he passed the greater part of his life in a very
poor public employment. He wrote large numbers of letters
to Lindner, Herder, Moses Mendelssohn, and other persons, and
published many short treatises, of the most miscellaneous in
kind, and the most eccentric and occasionally apocalyptic in style
and title. But he was in reality as deadly a foe of affectation
and sham as Carlyle himself, who, no doubt, took not a little
from him. His polemic with his friend, and townsman, and
“high-honoured Herr-magister” Kant (whom, however, one
shudders to find elsewhere described as <span lang="de">“ein guter</span> <span lang="la"><i>homunculus</i></span>”)
does not concern us. But it is almost impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>read a few pages in his works without coming across some
literary reference, more or less remarkable when its date is
considered. As early as 1759 he writes<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c010'><sup>[646]</sup></a> to Kant himself, <span lang="de">“Wir
schreiben für ein Volk das Maler und Dichter fordert”</span>; three
years later<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c010'><sup>[647]</sup></a> he entitles two of his quaint little pieces “Author
and Critic,” “Reader and Critic,” and fills them with ironic
wisdom. Earlier than these last, in May 1761,<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c010'><sup>[648]</sup></a> he has read
Diderot, and, like Lessing,<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c010'><sup>[649]</sup></a> has discovered in and with him
that rules are all very well, but that there is something “more
immediate, more intimate, obscurer, but more certain” than
the Rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is harsh, but by no means wholly unjust (as indeed we
have seen), when he finds, in <cite>The Elements of Criticism</cite>, <span lang="de">“Mehr
Worte und Wendungen als Sachen”</span>; he knows Burke; and
he leaves his “Magus”-tower to discuss Baretti and Goldoni.
Mystic as he is, he detects the emptiness of the new Æsthetic:<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c010'><sup>[650]</sup></a>
and consistently champions direct perception of literary and
other beauty in individual cases. It is admitted that his
Shakespeare study<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c010'><sup>[651]</sup></a> transmitted itself to Herder, upon whom
he had great influence: and, generally speaking, he may be
said to have exercised at least as much power in the germinal
and stimulating way upon the younger writers, who were to
form the great generation, as Lessing did in the way of dogma
and method. Against the mere <span lang="de"><i>Aufklärung</i></span> and against <span lang="de"><i>Sturm
und Drang</i></span>, Hamann was alike a conservative and preservative
agency: and he is one of the authors, now getting terribly
numerous, on whom I should like to spend much more time
and space than can be afforded here.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span></div>
<a id='sec8.3.2'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Lichtenberg.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There are rather strong points of resemblance between
Hamann and the somewhat younger Lichtenberg. Both were
very much influenced by visits to England, and
both show the inspiration or English humourists—especially
Swift—in their not exactly forced, but very decidedly
<em>purposed</em>, eccentricity. Lichtenberg, however, was more a man
of this world than the “Magus”: and he shows very much
more of the passion of the time for physics. Never did any
one’s writings better deserve the title of <span lang="de"><cite>Vermischte Schriften</cite></span><a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c010'><sup>[652]</sup></a>
than his, consisting as they do, for the most part, of a bewildering
assemblage of mote-articles, ranging from the question
“Why Germany has no seaside watering-place,”<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c010'><sup>[653]</sup></a> and from an
account of a “Sausage-Procession”<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c010'><sup>[654]</sup></a> (which gives a foretaste
not merely of Jean Paul but of <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite> itself) to serious
mathematical and physical discussions. Lichtenberg is perhaps
best known to English readers by his dealings with Garrick
and other English theatrical persons: but there is not a little
pure literature in him, outside as well as inside his two sets of
titularly literary <span lang="de"><cite>Bemerkungen</cite></span>.<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c010'><sup>[655]</sup></a> He has actual animadversions
on Pope, on Swift, on the early German drama even:
but his most noteworthy critical achievements are to be found
in more general maxims and judgments, many of them showing
that creditable anxiety for the literary improvement of his
country which the best men of his generation all felt, and
which was rewarded in and by the next. He stigmatises that
excessive <em>imitation</em> which even here we have had to notice:
he says plumply,<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c010'><sup>[656]</sup></a> <span lang="de"><cite>Die Deutschen lesen zu viel</cite></span>; he is prophetically,
as well as actually, notable on the process of
commenting and translating Shakespeare.<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c010'><sup>[657]</sup></a> But perhaps his best
judgment-epigram is on that critical vice which is the other
extreme from general denigration. “Men call,” says he, “others
by the name of genius, as wood-lice [<span lang="de"><i>Kelleresel</i></span>] are called Millepedes.
Not that they <em>have</em> a thousand legs, but that people
won’t take the trouble to count!”</p>

<a id='sec8.3.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Herder.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With Herder himself a different form of difficulty besets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the historian. Here there is no question of scattered literary
<span lang="la"><i>obiter dicta</i></span> occurring in a range of obstinately
miscellaneous thinking. Twenty volumes<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c010'><sup>[658]</sup></a> of ostensibly
and really literary work, of which something like a
full half is actual criticism, present themselves to the inquirer;
he knows, and everybody knows, that his author counts, as
hardly anybody else, save Lessing and Goethe, has counted,
in the literary development of one of the great “completely
equipped”<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c010'><sup>[659]</sup></a> literary nations of Europe; he can see, if he has any
eyes at all, that Herder is, with Lessing, Diderot, and the shy
and mainly apocryphal Gray, one of the very few leaders in the
conversion of Europe at large to a catholic study of literature.
And yet the arguments against any very full treatment of him
in such a book as this are twenty-legion strong.<a id='sec8.3.4'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>His drawbacks of tediousness,</i></span> In the first
place, there is what I can only call a certain
fearful <em>woolliness</em> about Herder’s literary work. It
scarcely ever compresses and crystallises itself into
a solid and fiery thunderbolt of literary expression. He himself,
in the very forefront of it,<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c010'><sup>[660]</sup></a> speaks of <span lang="de">“Die liebe Göttin
Langeweile,”</span> “the dear Goddess Ennui,” as having “hunted
many, if not most people, into the arms of the Muses.”  I am
afraid it must be said that in his own case the dear Goddess
did not understand where her mission as matchmaker ended,
and is too frequently present at the interviews of man and
Muse.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>pedagogy,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the second place, that pedagogic instinct which has been
noted, which is so excusable and so praiseworthy in him and in
his contemporaries, when we consider their circumstances
and <span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>, interferes somewhat disastrously
with the freedom and the lasting interest of his writing. The
Latin nations, by their inheritance of real or supposed prerogative
from Latin itself, we English by our alleged national self-sufficiency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>escape this in greater or less degree. All the four,
Italians, French, Spaniards, English, take themselves in their
different degrees and manners for granted; they are “men,” if
only in the University sense. The Germans of the mid-eighteenth
century are, and take themselves for, schoolboys:
it is greatly to their credit, but it does not precisely make
them good reading without a great deal of good will. <a id='sec8.3.6'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>and</i> meteorosophia,</span> Lastly
Herder, as it seems to me (though, no doubt, not to others),
in consequence of this sense of dissatisfaction with
his own literature, climbs too rapidly to generalisations
about the relation of literature itself to national character,
and to the connection of literature generally with the
whole idea of humanity. All this is noble; but we are in a
bad position for doing it. It will be a capital occupation for
persons of a critical temperament when humanity has come to
an end—which it has not even yet, and which it certainly had
still less in Herder’s time.<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c010'><sup>[661]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>but great merits.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These general disadvantages are indeed compensated by general
merits of a very eminent kind. Stimulated by Hamann,
by Lessing, and by his own soul, Herder betook
himself, as nobody had done before him, to the
comparative study of literature, to the appreciation of folksong
(perhaps his best desert), to the examination of Ancient,
Eastern, Foreign literature in comparison with German. This
is his great claim to consideration in the history of literature
and of criticism: and it is so great a one that in general one is
loath to cavil even at the most extravagant expressions of
admiration that have been lavished upon him.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Fragmente.</div>

<p class='c001'>But individual examination of his works revives the objections
taken above. For instance, the early <span lang="de"><cite>Fragmente zur
Deutschen Litteratur</cite></span><a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c010'><sup>[662]</sup></a> has an almost unique <em>relative</em>
interest. I do not know where to look for anything
like it as a survey (or rather a collection of studies) of a literature
at a given period of its development. On the language;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>on the prosody;<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c010'><sup>[663]</sup></a> on the “rhetoric” in the narrow-wide sense,
of German after the close of the Seven Years’ War; on the
chief authors and kinds of its literature; on a vast number
of minor points, positive and comparative, in relation to it,
Herder lavishes an amount of filial devotion, of learning,
of ability, which is quite admirable. Taken <em>absolutely</em>, the
value and the interest, and therefore the admiration, shrink
a little.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Kritische Walder.</div>

of the work of Winckelmann and of Lessing in
the <span lang="de"><cite>Laocoön</cite></span> (a continuation which, like its forerunners,
busied itself chiefly with the arts other than literature),
and then with some work of Lessing’s enemy, Klotz,<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c010'><sup>[665]</sup></a> somewhat
more directly literary in kind. Klotz, however, had
busied himself, and Herder necessarily busies himself in turn,
with general questions of the moral-literary type, especially
in reference to Homer and Virgil. The book is full of those
curious <span lang="de"><cite>Rettungen</cite></span> or “white-washings,” of which we have
previously referred to an example in speaking of Lessing on
Horace. But it has not very much for us.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is some more, though the quality may be differently
appreciated by different persons, in the Prize Essay of 1773
on the <cite>Causes of the Decline of Taste in different
Nations</cite>:<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c010'><sup>[666]</sup></a> and a great deal more in the twenty
years later <span lang="de"><cite>Ideen zur Geschichte und Kritik der Poesie
und bildenden Künste</cite></span>.<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c010'><sup>[667]</sup></a> In the first, Herder develops
(not of course for the first time, for Montesquieu had given
the line long before, if he had not applied it much to literature,
and Du Bos had started it before <em>him</em>, and Vico had in
a manner anticipated both; but for the first time in a wide,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>and at the same time not loose, application to literature itself)
the idea of Age- and Race-criticism—the close conjunction of
a general conception of the characteristics of a time and a
country with the phenomena observed or supposed to be
observed in groups of literary production. In theg second, at
once generalising further, and descending to further particulars,
we have an attempt to connect literature with general characteristics
of humanity, and almost innumerable critical experiments
of this process, on different authors and schools
and kinds.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>the</i> Ideen, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Anything that has to be said in general on these processes is
for the Interchapters; but we may here repeat that no one
can well exaggerate their historical importance or
the influence that they have exercised since.
Further, the merit of their combined precept and example, in
directing study at once to those features which are common
in all literature, and to the individual bodies by comparison of
which the general features are discernible, is quite beyond
question. The Prize Essay has perhaps the main defects of
its kind, that of “figuring away” in plausible gyration, without
bringing home any very solid sheaves, or even leaving any
definite path. But the immense Miscellany of the <span lang="de"><cite>Ideen</cite></span>
more than makes up for this. Herder’s general scheme, here,
in the <span lang="de"><cite>Adrastea</cite></span>,<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c010'><sup>[668]</sup></a> in that <span lang="de"><cite>Aurora</cite></span> (suggested by the dawn of
the nineteenth century) which he only planned, and which
was but a small part of the huge adventures for which he died
lamenting his lack of time, may be described as that of a
mediæval collection of <span lang="la"><cite>Quæstiones Quodlibetales</cite></span>,
methodised by the presence throughout of his
leading practical and theoretic ideas. <a id='sec8.3.12'></a><span class='sni side9'>Age-, Country-, and Race-, Criticism</span> These were,
as has been said, the necessity of enriching German
literature with material, and furnishing it with patterns,
“plant,” and processes, by the study of <em>all</em> literature, ancient
and modern, as a practical and immediate aim; and the
working out of the notions of literature, as connected with
the country, and literature, as connected with the general
race, for ultimate goal.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span></div>
<a id='sec8.3.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Specimens and Remarks.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But, owing to the enormous <em>dissipation</em>,—the constant flitting
from flower to flower which his task imposed on him,—Herder
was not and could not be a very important critic
on particular points. He was bound to share the
over-valuation of <cite>Ossian</cite><a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c010'><sup>[669]</sup></a>—for was not <cite>Ossian</cite> exactly
what was wanted to dissolve and lubricate the <span lang="fr"><i>sècheresse</i></span>
of French-German enlightenment, and did it not appear to
give a brilliant new example of “national” literature? So
we must not overblame him for this, any more than we
must overpraise him—while praising him heartily—for having
been undoubtedly the main agent in inoculating the Germans
with Shakespeare.<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c010'><sup>[670]</sup></a> Elias Schlegel had begun the process, and
Hamann had continued it; but the first was cut off too early
for him to do more than make a beginning, and Hamann’s
mission was rather to send others, including Herder himself,
than to work directly upon the general. It is also fair to
say that, with all his soaring ideals and world-wide aspirations
of mental travel, there was little <span lang="de"><i>Schwärmerei</i></span> about Herder,
except in a few semi-poetical passages, which can easily be
skipped. His judgment is a pretty sound and sensible one,
if his taste is not infallible—see for instance his remarks on
political poetry (xvi. 169, <i>op. cit.</i>), and the equally modest and
intelligent observations which follow on the impossibility of
emulating or surpassing the special qualities of foreign literatures,
however useful these literatures may be for study.<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c010'><sup>[671]</sup></a> To
any nation Herder must have been a useful and stimulating
teacher; to the Germans at this time he was simply invaluable.
But the definition of his general scope, and these few particulars
of his procedure, must suffice us here.<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c010'><sup>[672]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Wieland.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Wieland, the other chief of German <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> between
Lessing and Goethe, is also one of those writers—necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>thickening upon us as we proceed—who were very important
to their own times and countries, but whose importance
historically is here less a matter for detailed
investigation than for general summary. His extensive work<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c010'><sup>[673]</sup></a>
is full of criticism; indeed his position as editor of the <span lang="de"><cite>Teutsche
Merkur</cite></span> was one of the most responsible and not of the least
influential in the great German period. The curious modernised-classical
or classicalised-modern novels and miscellanies
of which he was so fond—especially the <span lang="de"><cite>Abderiten</cite></span>—abound
in it, in a more or less dissolved and diffused state; the seven
or eight volumes of his miscellaneous works<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c010'><sup>[674]</sup></a> contain more
in a precipitated and concentrated condition. Now he will
ask—but perhaps not answer—the question, <span lang="de">“Was ist eine
schöne Seele?”</span><a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c010'><sup>[675]</sup></a> then discourse (after the fashion of Burke
and Barnwell and Bulwer) on “the Relation of the Agreeable
and Beautiful to the Useful”;<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c010'><sup>[676]</sup></a> then come closer still to real
practical criticism in the interesting <span lang="de">“Sendschriften an einen
Jungen Dichter”</span> of 1784.<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c010'><sup>[677]</sup></a> The alphabetically arranged reviews
and notices which fill, or help to fill, the three last volumes deal
with all manner of authors and books, from Aristophanes to
the <span lang="de"><cite>Amadis</cite></span>, and from Louise Labé to Luis Vivès. In all,
modified to some extent by the influence which his greater
juniors exercised latterly on him, there appears that somewhat
rococo, but interesting, attractive, and very largely beneficent
blend or coupling of wit and imagination (or at least fancy)
which is Wieland’s characteristic, and which undoubtedly did
much—very much—to raise the Germans out of another
and much less attractive mixture of pedantry and horse-play
and bombast. But his individual critical utterances are of
less importance to us. And so to Goethe himself.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Goethe.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In a certain sense the whole six-and-thirty volumes<a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c010'><sup>[678]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Goethe’s work, with all the <cite>Letters</cite> and <cite>Conversations</cite> added,
may be said to be a record of his criticism: in
this sense he certainly deserved the hackneyed
“nothing if not—--” But for our purposes, though we may
step beyond them now and then, the famous passages in
<span lang="de"><cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite></span> and elsewhere (especially <span lang="de">“Shakespeare und
Keine Ende”</span>) on Shakespeare, the <span lang="de"><cite>Sprüche in Prosa</cite></span>, the collected
papers on German and other literature, and the <span lang="de"><cite>Conversations</cite></span>
with Eckermann, will give a sufficient collection of texts.
The <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span> will be more conveniently postponed till we
deal with their other author.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Hamlet <i>criticism, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One thing must or should have struck every reader (at
all accustomed to draw conclusions from what he reads) about
the <cite>Hamlet</cite> passages in <span lang="de"><cite>Meister</cite></span>.<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c010'><sup>[679]</sup></a> <em>These passages
might have been written by a man who was only
acquainted with a prose translation of the piece into a language
other than its own.</em> This may seem a little staggering: but
it is true.  Goethe handles—with extraordinary and for the
most part unerring insight—the characters, the situations, the
conduct of the play. But there he stops dead. Of its magnificent
and ineffable poetical <em>expression</em>—of those phrases and
passages which, read hundreds of times through scores of years,
produce as much effect on the fit reader as at first, and more—he
says nothing. <span lang="de">“Shakespeare und Keine Ende”</span> tells the
same story: nearly all, if not all, the scattered references from
the Frankfort speech of 1771, when he was just of age, to
the last remark to Eckermann sixty years later, tell the same.
It is at least a curious one. One begins to wonder whether
the person who wrote Shakespeare was, not Bacon, but, say,
Wieland.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Sprüche in Prosa.</div>

<p class='c001'>Many things, however, might, and some perhaps shall, be said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>about this. Let us turn to the more miscellaneous and general
utterances of the <span lang="de"><cite>Sprüche in Prosa</cite></span>, which, with the
parallel verse jottings, especially some of the <span lang="de"><cite>Zahme
Xenien</cite></span>, are recognised as supplying a sort of running accompaniment
of Goethe’s thought, for all periods of his life. No
one (again with the same slight goodwill to think) can read
far in either of these divisions, much less in both of them,
without perceiving the very strong, we might almost call it
the overbearing, practical and ethical tendency, even of those
passages which apparently bear most closely on literature. All
the best things are <em>generalised</em> as much as possible, with perhaps
some forgetfulness of the writer’s own caution about <span lang="de"><cite>Allgemeine
Begriffe</cite></span>.<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c010'><sup>[680]</sup></a> In these generalities there is much that is admirable,
such as the famous “Superstition is the poetry of life,”<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c010'><sup>[681]</sup></a> and
the much less known but very striking “Rhythmical movement
has something magical about it: it makes us believe that
the Sublime is our own property.”<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c010'><sup>[682]</sup></a> The danger appears in
his often-quoted comparison of Classicism to Health and
Romanticism to disease<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c010'><sup>[683]</sup></a>—if he had said “Classicism is precaution
against disease: Romanticism is making the best of
that which must come,” there would have been something
to say for him. But it is far off in the admirable, “There
are pedants who are also scoundrels; and they are the worst
of all.”<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c010'><sup>[684]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But when we pass from these generalities—disputable
sometimes, indisputable not seldom, almost always stimulating—to
individual judgments, the case is a little altered. If
he had oftener written such notes as “<span lang="la"><i>Vis superba formæ</i></span>.
<span lang="de"><cite>Ein schönes Wort von Johannes Secundus</cite></span>,”<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c010'><sup>[685]</sup></a> it had been
better. What is the good of saying of <cite>Henry IV.</cite><a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c010'><sup>[686]</sup></a> that “If
everything else extant of the kind were lost, we could restore
poetry and rhetoric completely out of this alone”? Nobody
shall outgo me in rational admiration of <cite>Henry IV.</cite> I will
not give up a hair of Doll Tearsheet’s head, nor a blush of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the page’s cheek. Everything in it is good: but to say that
everything that is good is in it would deepen the inscrutable
smile on Shakespeare’s face a little less inscrutably. The
saying, however, may perhaps be allowed the credit, as well
as the discredit, due to enthusiastic exaggerations. This is
not the case with the passages on Sterne,<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c010'><sup>[687]</sup></a> which are numerous,
which form a tolerably complete context, and which are yet
separated from each other, and returned upon, in a fashion
which shows what a strong impression the subject had made
on the writer’s mind.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Sterne passages.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We begin with the sufficiently round statement, “Yorick
Sterne was the finest<a id='r688'></a><a href='#f688' class='c010'><sup>[688]</sup></a> spirit that ever worked. Whosoever
reads him has at once the feeling of freedom
and beauty; his humour is inimitable, and not
every kind of Humour frees the soul.” Now, as a thing said
once, this would be surprising enough, however well we
may think of Sterne: but Goethe does not leave it alone.
After the widest casts round to the general aspects of
Poetry and Science, Art and Humour, he circles back to
“Tristram.” “Even at this moment” (the context shows that
this must have been pretty late in his life), “every
man of culture should take his works once more in hand,
that the nineteenth century may learn what we owe him
already, and look out for what we may still owe him.” Another
page and more of generalities, and he harks back again.
“Sterne was born in 1713 and died in 1768. To comprehend
him one must not leave out of consideration the moral and
ecclesiastical state of his time: we should remember that
he was Warburton’s contemporary.” And then a context of
notes remarks on his “free spirit,” “his power of developing
things from within,” of “distinguishing truth from falsehood,”
his “hatred for the didactic-dogmatic, the pedantic tendencies
of the serious”; his wide reading and discoveries of “the
inadequate and the ridiculous”; his “boundless sagacity and
penetration,” and a great many other things. Admitting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Sterne is “never a model,” he thinks him “always suggestive
and stimulating,” and makes the charitable remark that “the
element of coarseness in him, <em>in which he moves so carefully
and elegantly</em>, might have spoilt many others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this is at first odder than the hyperbole about <cite>Henry IV.</cite>,
and takes one’s breath away more completely for the moment.
One may have a very strong liking for “Atalanta’s better part,”
for the lightness, grace, good sense, refreshing qualities of
Shandyism, and a very great admiration for Sterne’s genius,
especially for the uniqueness, if not exactly the impeccability,
of its literary expression. But to make of him, even to the
extent to which it is possible to make of his master Rabelais,
an author to be turned over by day and night, a <span lang="la"><i>vade mecum</i></span>,
a great teacher, a literary discoverer and deliverer, the
“finest spirit that ever worked”—this is really going rather
too far. Yet the point of view is perfectly obvious, and it is
equally obvious that it is not a literary point of view at all.
Goethe felt severely the Philistinism of his own country, and
he had—as most Continentals always have had, and as some
dear good Englishmen think it proper still to have—the idea
that England was specially dominated by the weaver’s beam.
Sterne to him is a David: his jests and pranks are the small
stones of the brook, and he thinks of nothing more than of the
discomfiture of Goliath.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet he could be Philistine enough himself, as where, in
<span lang="de"><cite>Shakespeare und Keine Ende</cite></span>, having talked of the universality
of Shakespeare<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c010'><sup>[689]</sup></a> more mysteriously and pretentiously, but far
less intelligently and forcibly, than Dryden a century and more
earlier, he tells us that “Coriolanus is <em>pervaded throughout</em> by
the chagrin experienced at the refusal of the mob to recognise
the choice of its betters.” In <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> “<em>everything
rests on</em> the idea that the leaders are averse to seeing the
highest place filled, because they wrongly imagine that they
can work successfully in co-operation.” <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>“declares with a thousand tongues [<em>plus</em> a thousand copybook
headings?] that idle enjoyment is incompatible with a life of
activity.” We have all heard of Goethe as a great and true
Apollo, a Philistine-slayer from youth to age. Was there
ever more platitudinous and trivial chatter of Ashdod than in
these three sentences? And how, again, when we find him,
like a seventeenth-century Preceptist, dividing literary motives
into Progressive, Retrogressive, Retardative, Retrospective, and
Anticipatory, a list which yet once again sets one thinking,
with a shameful joy, on possible Rabelaisian developments and
parodies of it? Is our own poor Alison, with his Bandit unequally
yoked to a Grecian nose<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c010'><sup>[690]</sup></a>—are the poor Le Bossus and
Rapins themselves—to be scoffed at, when we find this Jove
of Weimar and Germany laying it down that “Christians contending
with Christians will not, especially in later times, form
a good picture,” but that “Christians conquering Turks” are
admissible?</p>

<a id='sec8.3.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Reviews and Notices.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The very numerous literary reviews and notices which fill
nearly two volumes<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c010'><sup>[691]</sup></a> of the Works in the edition we are using
must, of course, be read by every one who desires
to acquaint himself thoroughly with Goethe’s criticism:
but they have not quite the importance which they
might be expected to have, and very often, when they are at
their best, that best comes to little or nothing more than we
find condensed and quintessenced in a maxim of the <span lang="de"><i>Sprüche</i></span>
or a sentence of the <cite>Conversations</cite>. This indeed could not be
otherwise: for the most “panoramic intellect” (a phrase which
Goethe acknowledged with rather sardonic politeness when it
was applied to him by some English critic<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c010'><sup>[692]</sup></a>) cannot see, and
the most facund tongue cannot say, the same thing differently
every time. Even in the earliest there are very neat things,
as where<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c010'><sup>[693]</sup></a> poor Sulzer’s <span lang="de"><cite>Die Schönen Künste</cite></span> is described in the
opening sentence of the review as “Very suitable for translation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>into French: indeed it might very well have been translated
<em>from</em> French.” The very latest, such as that on Mérimée’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>La Guzla</cite></span>,<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c010'><sup>[694]</sup></a> display that combination of fresh interest, impartial
judgment, and experienced knowledge which ought to be the
reviewer’s equipment, but which unluckily few attain.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Conversations.</div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, however, the <cite>Conversations with Eckermann</cite> are
the richest <span lang="fr"><i>placer</i></span> of Goethe’s criticism, and the most convenient
for the general reader. There appears to be no
reason for any exaggerated scruples about admitting
them as genuine and trustworthy. Eckermann, no doubt, has
some of the irritating qualities which are almost inseparable
from the Boswellian temperament: one need not be ashamed
of enjoying that characteristic Heinesquery, the regret</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But this need not prevent our being thankful that Eckermann
remained <span lang="de"><i>zu Leben</i></span> long enough to put these things on record.
There is nothing in the least disloyal or disgusting about them:
the sternest hater of eavesdropping need not be afraid or
ashamed to take up the book. And Eckermann seems to have
been very fairly in possession of the two positive and the one
negative qualities required by his difficult and rather thankless
art—exactness, intelligence up to a certain point, and the
absence of the superfluous cleverness which might have tempted
him to refine, and touch up, and overlay. Therefore some
analysis of the chief critical utterances of the book should
find a place here. It must, moreover, always be remembered
that Goethe was a man soaked in literature, and that those
who read him without having at least dipped in it are
apt to make mistakes.<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c010'><sup>[695]</sup></a>  Pretty early we have one of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>striking generalities which catch mankind, and which—in a
sense not unjustly—have earned their author his immense
reputation. “Fact must give the motive, the points that require
expression the particular kernel; but to make a beautiful
enlivened whole, <em>that</em> is the business of the poet.”<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c010'><sup>[696]</sup></a> The
practical advice about a certain job of verse<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c010'><sup>[697]</sup></a> is as good as it
can be, and as we should expect it to be; to find a better and
more <em>conscious</em> craftsman of letters than Goethe, you may take
the wings of the morning and put a girdle round the earth in
vain. Nor perhaps is much more needed than mere quotation
for the three words on the opposite page, <span lang="de"><i>Ach, das Publikum!</i></span>
There is a very noteworthy passage<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c010'><sup>[698]</sup></a> on Schiller and
his philosophy, and a still more noteworthy one,<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c010'><sup>[699]</sup></a> indeed
one of the cardinal places of the whole, on the character of
writers, with a context—accidental as far as dates go (for
there is a full fortnight between them), but real in thought—on
Style.</p>

<p class='c001'>The classification of his enemies<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c010'><sup>[700]</sup></a> is very interesting and
curious, as are, both from the critical and the personal standpoint,
the observations<a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c010'><sup>[701]</sup></a> on Klopstock and Herder. But
what follows<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c010'><sup>[702]</sup></a> immediately, on the contemporarily intimate
relations between France and Germany in literature, is more
noteworthy still, and so is, especially when we take account
of the dates and of other places, Goethe’s dissuasion<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c010'><sup>[703]</sup></a> of
Eckermann from undertaking a <span lang="fr"><i>compte-rendu</i></span> of German Literature
for an English Review. At this very time<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c010'><sup>[704]</sup></a> the <cite>Globe</cite>
was being founded in Paris: and Goethe’s admiration for the
<cite>Globe</cite> was unbounded. J. J. Ampère he knew personally: but
the praise which so constantly recurs applies to Sainte-Beuve,
Rémusat, and others almost more than to Ampère. In one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>place later, he expresses his surprise that these young French
reviewers did not think it necessary, as the Germans did, to
“hate one another” if they differed in opinion.<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c010'><sup>[705]</sup></a>  Alas! the
disease was not, and is not, confined to Germany: and it
certainly did not spare these same contributors to the <cite>Globe</cite>.
But their width of range, their comparative spirit, their judicial
and yet not pedagogic manner, justly enchanted Goethe. And
it was doubtless because he did not, in 1824, think it possible
for a reviewer to show them, that he bade Eckermann not “eat
the beans” of reviewing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The passage<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c010'><sup>[706]</sup></a> which naturally and immediately follows on
the connection of German and English literature, and the
frank avowal of the enormous indebtedness of the former to
the latter, is deservedly famous, and certainly shows Goethe
most favourably in the light of that combined lamp of intelligence,
learning, and character which he himself always liked
to turn on his subject. But one does not read with so much
satisfaction what follows at a little distance on the sufficiency
of translation,<a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c010'><sup>[707]</sup></a> a passage at which, I feel sure, all the Muses
wept. Scientifically, morally, practically, translation can do
much: from the point of view of pure literature, all it can do
is to supply something different from the original—good perhaps,
bad perhaps, between the two most probably, but never
<em>the</em> original. Once more he refers valuably<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c010'><sup>[708]</sup></a> to the great older
contemporaries of his youth—Lessing, Herder, Wieland, as
well as to Schiller. Always we may apply to Goethe when
he speaks of Schiller what Thackeray says so well of Pope<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c010'><sup>[709]</sup></a>
when he speaks of Swift. His remarks on Menander in more
places than one supply a very curious document, or item of a
document, as to his criticism generally, when we reflect in what
a fragmentary state the great New Comic has come down to
us. Many notable passages on Shakespeare and Molière
follow: indeed, the various contexts on Molière should be as
carefully looked at and compared as those on Shakespeare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Byron, and Scott. They will form, with these, the chief bases
of our general estimate of Goethe’s criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The judgment<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c010'><sup>[710]</sup></a> of January 1827 on Hugo is famous and
interesting. More favourable than later ones, it shows the
critic’s eclecticism, if not quite his catholicity. He saw, and
saw rightly, the connection with Chateaubriand: and we must
not <em>now</em> be too severe on him for thinking <em>then</em> that Hugo
“may be as important as Lamartine and Delavigne.” A less
agreeable side of his criticism—one to which we have had, and
shall have, to turn and return—is the remark on Flemming,<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c010'><sup>[711]</sup></a>
<span lang="de"><i>er kann jetz nicht mehr helfen</i></span>. Now Flemming certainly was
not a very great poet; he <em>has</em> only “a very pretty talent, rather
prosaic and <span lang="fr"><i>bourgeois</i></span>.” But the <span lang="de">“er kann jetz nicht mehr
<em>helfen</em>”</span> is hard to forgive. It is a point of view which has
done harm to many, notably to Mr. Arnold: but that is between
the Muses and themselves. What concerns us, is that
it is bad in itself. The idea that such and such a writer
“won’t <em>pay</em>,” that you can’t “get culture” out of him, is the
pure Philistinism of culture itself. It is the exact analogue
to the theory and practice of “saving your own dirty soul”
in religion.  What does it matter whether he “helps” or not,
if he is good and, in his own little or large measure, delights?
This calculus of profit is mighty disgusting and, we may add,
mighty dangerous: for it is at the root of much of the bad
criticism in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is in his better mind, and in his own sphere, with the
remark<a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c010'><sup>[712]</sup></a> that now, fifty years ago, and fifty years hence, it is,
was, will be so that what men wrote when they were young
will be best enjoyed by young men. And we may note in
passing wise and witty things on destructive criticism,<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c010'><sup>[713]</sup></a> on
Smollett,<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c010'><sup>[714]</sup></a> on <span lang="de"><i>Lazaret-poesie</i></span>,<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c010'><sup>[715]</sup></a> before leaving with a good taste in
our mouth, the first and, for literary utterances I think the
weightiest, volume of the <cite>Conversations</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good example of that common-sense judgment which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>perhaps Goethe’s chief claim as a critic is to be found early
in vol. ii.,<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c010'><sup>[716]</sup></a> where he speaks of Aristotle as “rash in his
opinions.” At first sight this may seem not merely impertinent,
but contradictory of the facts: and yet there is much
in it. Undoubtedly Aristotle, great as he is, <em>was</em> rash, with
the peculiar Greek rashness of imagining that Greek facts
were all facts: and this was nowhere more the case than in
his literary criticism. We may be less happy—on the same
page and the next—with a repetition of Philistinisms against
Fouqué and the Middle Ages, about there being “nothing
worth our fetching from these dim old German times,” or with
an additional mistake (which again has done much harm) about
the “miseries” of these said times and the uselessness of adding
them to our own. How much better is a fresh application of
“the apples of gold and pictures [frames] of silver,” a metaphor
of which he was fond, a little later! <span lang="de">“Die Frauen,”</span> says he,<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c010'><sup>[717]</sup></a>
<span lang="de">“sind silberne Schalen in die <em>wir</em> goldene Aepfel legen.”</span> In
other words, their worth and their fairness are their fairness
and their worth to <em>our</em> imagination, which indeed is the conclusion
of the whole matter, not merely in gynæcology. His
statement as to Voltaire<a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c010'><sup>[718]</sup></a> that “everything which so great a
talent writes is good,” is interesting to compare with the direct
negative of Joubert. And it may repay anybody if he thinks
a little about its connection with a more general and very
important statement of Goethe’s, that “in Art and Poetry
Personality is everything,”<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c010'><sup>[719]</sup></a> wherewith also it were well to
combine his frequent references<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c010'><sup>[720]</sup></a> to his favourite idea of the
“dæmonic.” His extreme and repeated<a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c010'><sup>[721]</sup></a> admiration of <span lang="fr"><cite>Daphnis
and Chloe</cite></span> (undoubtedly a charming thing) is to be noted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third volume, giving us<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c010'><sup>[722]</sup></a> Eckermann’s second skimmings
of his notes and memories, is, perhaps naturally, less fruitful, but
it is far from barren. Another of the audacious and felicitous
phrases which have done so much to establish Goethe’s fame
is that<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c010'><sup>[723]</sup></a> about Shakespeare’s “unflustered, innocent, <em>sleepwalkerish</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>manner of production”: and the passage on Schlegel<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c010'><sup>[724]</sup></a>
is a good combination of magnanimity and veracity. One of
the strangest blunders of interpretation ever made by such a
man is that by which he makes<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c010'><sup>[725]</sup></a> Macduff’s “He has no
children” apply to Macbeth instead of to Malcolm, thereby
not only making necessary a clumsy explaining-away of Lady
Macbeth’s own words, but spoiling the poetry of the actual
passage. In the same context comes the contradiction of himself,
that Shakespeare thought mainly of the stage when he
wrote.<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c010'><sup>[726]</sup></a> On the other hand, the passage<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c010'><sup>[727]</sup></a> on Burns, Béranger,
and the effect on literary talent of an exciting atmosphere of
various kinds, from the clash of sentiment and thought in a
city like Paris to the inspiration of traditional ballad-literature,
is all but consummate in a certain way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then read him on the <em>incommensurableness</em> of poetry,<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c010'><sup>[728]</sup></a> and (in
a happier vein about Classic and Romantic than that which has
been noticed) pronouncing<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c010'><sup>[729]</sup></a> that, for all the fuss (<span lang="de"><cite>Lärme</cite></span>) about
the two, “a work that is good all through will be a classic sure
enough,” and you may leave him in a state of reconciliation
which, in wise persons, will not be disturbed by later utterances
on French authors, Guizot, Villemain, Mérimée, Victor Hugo
even, though on the latter you may think that he has got at
a wrong angle. After all, one may say that Hugo and not
Goethe was in that position: for few persons with a critical
head now think of the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Marion de l’Orme</cite></span> as they
think of the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Contemplations</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Légende</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.21'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Some more general things: Goethe on Scott and Byron.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To proceed from particulars to mediate generalities, a very
instructive light on Goethe’s general critical attitude may be
obtained by comparing his expressions in regard to Scott and
to Byron.<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c010'><sup>[730]</sup></a> He admires both. But in regard to Scott he
justifies his admiration. His analysis to Eckermann<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c010'><sup>[731]</sup></a> of <cite>The
Fair Maid of Perth</cite> is really critical: he points out how good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>this passage is, how cunningly that episode is worked in, how
powerful is that other picture. He praises <cite>Rob Roy</cite>
in the same manner,<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c010'><sup>[732]</sup></a> “going at the jugular,” selecting
the truth of detail, the <span lang="de"><i>unendliche Fleiss in den
Vorstudien</i></span> (the very thing which shallow critics
deny to Scott), and so forth. Now, his eulogies
of Byron are quite different. They are nearly all in generals;
the most definite passage that I remember, about the wigshops
and lamplighters in <cite>Don Juan</cite>, comes from Eckermann’s mouth,
not Goethe’s. The great man himself is struck by Byron’s
social and political position; he is lost in wonder at Byron’s
real or supposed revolt against what he, like others, supposes
to have been English Philistinism (the Philistinism of Shakespeare,
Swift, Fielding!), and the like. It is never a phrase,
a passage, a situation, hardly ever a book<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c010'><sup>[733]</sup></a> that he praises.
And I do not know a closer approach to the merely and
purely <span lang="fr"><i>bête</i></span> in a writer of the greatest literary, and of great
critical, genius than the remark<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c010'><sup>[734]</sup></a> that a few lines of <cite>Don
Juan</cite> “poison the whole <cite>Gerusalemme</cite>.” It would be as
sensible to say that one stanza of Tasso is an antidote to
the whole of <cite>Don Juan</cite>. The two things are “incommensurable,”
and severed by a gulf.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On the historic and comparative estimate of literature.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Another remarkable thing about Goethe’s criticism, which
might be illustrated from the <span lang="de"><cite>Sprüche</cite></span>, from Eckermann, and
from other sources, may again surprise those who
have simply adopted the common opinion of him as
an apostle of universal culture. Curiously enough,
he, the “Doctor Universalis” of nineteenth-century
literature, as some would make him, distinctly discourages and
disparages that historic study of Comparative Letters which is
the distinguishing nineteenth-century principle. His warning
to the Germans, that they have most to lose by the introduction
of a “world-literature,” is no doubt true enough <span lang="la"><i>ad hoc</i></span>
or <span lang="la"><i>ad hos</i></span>: and when, close by, he emits the wish, “May the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>study of Greek and Roman literature remain the basis of the
higher Culture,” we can only say “Amen, and Amen” ever-lastingly.
But his stigmatisation of Chinese, Indian, Egyptian
literatures as <span lang="de"><cite>Curiositäten</cite></span>—useless for moral and æsthetic
culture—is very tell-tale: and even the most experienced
person may be slightly shocked when he finds Goethe extending
this taboo to European-mediæval letters as well.<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c010'><sup>[735]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Summing up: the merits of Goethe’s criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I hope that it is not extravagant to think that this selection
of the actual facts of the case, individual and grouped, may
serve to base, with some solidity, a judgment of
Goethe’s actual position as a critic. For a considerable
time, let us say roundly the middle forty
years of the nineteenth century, from 1830 to 1870,
this position, very mainly owing to the efforts of a large
number of great men from Carlyle downwards, was exalted
to the very skies: and even more recently it has been rather
left alone than seriously attacked. The causes of this—causes
which to some extent are true causes and must always operate—may
be put shortly as follows. Goethe possessed, to an
extraordinary degree, and later perhaps than any one else,
that singular <em>wisdom</em> which has been more than once animadverted
upon as the property, in the strict sense, of the
eighteenth century. He was, for half its length and for
nearly two-thirds of his own life, a man of its own: and he
never escaped, or wished to escape, entirely from its influence.
He was always “in touch” with life and fact: there was
“no nonsense about him,” to use an excellent vernacular phrase
which, if somewhat double-edged, has a keen and heavily
backed edge on the favourable side. There are no “Samothracian
mysteries of bottled moonshine” in him; the most
apparently dreamy parts of his loftiest and greatest things, such
as the second part of <cite>Faust</cite>, are always, like natural and healthy
dreams, merely sublimations of actual facts—experienced or
capable of being experienced.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>But further, and on the other hand, he had, from very early
youth, and by the favour of those of “the Mothers” who
allow men of great genius to anticipate and combine the gifts
which most have only later and separately, a very strong infusion
indeed of Romance <em>and</em> of Science—the two apparently
opposite characteristics of the century to which his last thirty
years belonged.  He had hardly a touch of the special stupidity
which accompanied the special cleverness of his earlier
century—the degeneration of “common-sense.”  In him the
fashionable and epidemic diseases of the Neo-classic period
were neutralised by the appropriate agencies, without any of
these turning to the morbid. The comparison of <span lang="de"><cite>Goetz</cite></span> with
<cite>The Robbers</cite> is an education in pathological criticism.  Nobody
ever served under two flags with such honour and credit as
Goethe; he may even be said to have effected, if not alone, yet
mainly, a reconciliation and junction of arms between his two
masters.  Yet again his almost unique mastery (just glanced
at) of the tendencies of the morrow; his sympathy, in his age,
and when he was in a way the greatest man of letters in
Europe, with the ideas, tastes, aspirations of quite young
men—not merely secured, but to no very small extent deserved,
the enthusiastic adhesion of these latter.  And when
we add to these powerful general things his extraordinary
literary gifts, the still more extraordinary range of his interests,
the Olympian good-nature of his character, and his singular,
and almost supra- or infra-human, avoidance of extremes, it
ceases to be at all surprising that the position above noted
should have seemed to good wits to be his: it may even seem
ungracious, pedantic, absurd to take any exceptions to it.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its drawbacks: too much of his age.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet the exceptions must be taken, and, if possible, made
good.  The greatest of them—at least, according to those
general lines which he himself loved and followed—is
connected with that peculiarity of his which has
been noticed a few lines previously.  He is just a
little too much of the day and the morrow combined—not
enough of yesterdays and to-morrows far behind
and far ahead.  The least local and temporary of those who
are for an age—possessor of the widest “age” perhaps of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>all—he is still of that age, and, except in criticisms that are
of life rather than of literature, not sufficiently of all time. As
we have seen and shown, he cannot duly appreciate the Middle
Ages; and the fact that others were over-appreciating them
does not excuse him a whit. In his formative precepts he
looks too much to what he thought the requirements of actual
nineteenth-century literature—a modified Romanticism, not
excluding Science. In other words, he keeps time without
winding for a longer period than any other clock on record, but
he is perhaps rather impossible to wind afresh. On that calculus
of his own which we have disallowed and protested
against, which we shall shortly disallow and protest against
afresh, one might too often say that <em>he</em> cannot “help us any
more.” He is not as “rash in his opinions” as he thought
Aristotle was, but he is more inadequate; we can nowadays
allow for and discard Aristotle’s rashness, and find abundance
of the eternal left in him, and we cannot quite do this with
Goethe. We must sometimes, with Aristotle, have, and mark,
the side-note, “This was a man of the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>”;
we must always with Goethe have the other, “This was the
cleverest man of 1770-1830.” Take him again with Longinus,
and we find that Longinus needs hardly any side-note at all—only
here and there in utterances such as that about the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>. And I at least think that Coleridge, though he certainly
needs it here and there, needs it seldomer, far seldomer,
than Goethe.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Too much a utilitarian of Culture.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But there is another count. Goethe, as everybody knows,
had a private chapel (which has bred chantries and churches
and cathedrals all over the world), with an ephod
and teraphim and everything complete, dedicated
to the great god, Cham-Chi-Thaungu, otherwise called
Culture. It is ill to be joined to any idols: and this was well
seen of him. “This cannot help us,” he says constantly; “we
cannot fetch any good out of this.” “Such times, such books,
such men have nothing to say for us.” Now, such sentences,
from the point of view of the really higher criticism, are
anathema, because they are <em>negative</em>. The corresponding positives
are not condemnable at all. If a thing does help any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>one, if any can fetch good, or delight, out of it, it passes at
once—in a low class perhaps, perhaps in a high—but it passes.
That it does <em>not</em> help any particular person proves nothing at
all. If the work is good, on its own scale and specification,
it can afford to wait for the persons whom it will help, to
whom it will “give culture.” Its beauty is its sole duty.
Indeed “What <em>is</em> culture?” is a question to be asked not at
all jestingly, and it will be hard to find the answer.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Unduly neglectful of literature as literature.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet once more the specimens given (I believe quite fairly)
above entitle us—and all but the most blindly fanatical
<span lang="de"><i>Goetheaner</i></span> will find it hard to <em>dis</em>entitle us from the
observation—to observe in them a constant deflection
from strictly literary consideration of things.
He likes to consider “poetry” rather than “poesy,”
poets rather than poetry; and in poets he is always considering
the not strictly poetical qualities. He extols, for instance,
in a well-known passage, Byron’s <span lang="de">“Keckheit, Kühnheit,
Grandiosität.”</span> Now the last, though a somewhat questionable,
may be a real, poetical quality: but what is there essentially
poetical in <span lang="de"><cite>Keckheit</cite></span> and <span lang="de"><cite>Kühnheit</cite></span>? The occasion requiring
them, it is good that a poet—as that a fox-hunter, a
sub-lieutenant left in command of the regiment, a householder
facing a fire or a burglar at two o’clock in the morning—should
have them: but what is there specially <em>poetical</em> about them?
On the contrary, may not a man have them and be, in virtue
of having them, a bad, and the worse, poet? Character, conduct,
personality (the second construed in a liberal way), these
things are what Goethe is always harping on. Now, ten generations
of foes and friends have (with the good leave of some
friends as well as foes of mine) been able to make out next to
nothing at all about Shakespeare’s character, conduct, and
personality. Yet most people think that Shakespeare was,
let us say, one of the great poets of the world. Shelley’s
character was rather weak; his conduct was sometimes disgusting;
his personality, though generally amiable, is very
vague; and some of us think him the “next poet,” not merely
the next English poet, to Shakespeare. We may be wrong:
but our case is a case.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Therefore, insolent absurdity as it may seem, I venture to
doubt whether Goethe’s criticism is of the absolutely greatest
value.  We have met with many marks or notes of the true
critic in our “journey across Chaos,” and some of them Goethe
has. But there are most important ones which he lacks.
That he is a great <em>dramatic</em> critic I can very well admit: but
his very greatness here, on the principle more than once referred
to, makes him a dubious critic of literature. For the Goethe
of <em>Faust</em> (not least of the Second Part of it), of the best lyrics,
and of some other things, I have, and for a great number
of years have had, almost unlimited admiration: for the
critical Goethe I feel very much less. That, assisted by natural
xenomania, he was a great revelation to Englishmen seventy,
eighty, even a hundred years ago, I can very well allow and
believe: that he was a valuable populariser of a critical attitude,
useful as an alterative to that of Neo-classicism, I know.
But I am less sure that there is much in him, as he would himself
say, for us now. Aristotle, Longinus, Coleridge, are <em>creeds</em>:
though the first and second are too succinct and the last too
discursive and full of <span lang="la"><i>lacunæ</i></span>. I can admit even Scaliger, even
Boileau, to be of the calibre of a will-worship. But Goethe,
the critical Goethe, has too much the character of a superstition,
now rather stale.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Schiller.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Schiller’s critical position, which some have estimated very
highly, depends first upon the collection of small æsthetic
treatises, and of a few actual reviews, which is
included in his prose works;<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c010'><sup>[736]</sup></a> secondly, in his share
of the <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span>; and thirdly, in the critical utterances of his
<cite>Letters</cite>, especially those in the correspondence with Goethe,
though by no means neglecting those to others, especially
Körner. With regard to the first part of the first division,
extraordinary importance has been attached to it by some—importance
which a wary person would be slow to accept on
trust, when he remembers, not merely the remarks of A. W.
Schlegel, a declared unfriend, but those of Goethe, Schiller’s
unflinching defender, and those of Novalis, a very competent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>and apparently quite dispassionate observer.<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c010'><sup>[737]</sup></a> Much, however,
will of course depend on the estimation in which “æsthetic
salt for putting on the tail of the Ideal”<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c010'><sup>[738]</sup></a> is itself held.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His Æsthetic Discourses.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The very strong inclination of the poet towards the abstract
discussion is shown in his “Dissertation on the Connection
of the Animal Nature of man with the Spiritual,”
written and printed in his twenty-first year: as
well as in others nearly as early. And few things of the kind
can be more curious than the comparison of the <span lang="de">“Briefe über
<cite>Don Carlos</cite>”</span> with such other defences of a man’s own work
as Dryden’s or <a id='corr378.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Corneillle’s'>Corneille’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_378.11'><ins class='correction' title='Corneillle’s'>Corneille’s</ins></a></span>.<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c010'><sup>[739]</sup></a> The Discourses on Tragedy,<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c010'><sup>[740]</sup></a> which
appeared in the <cite>Thalia</cite> for 1792, of course have their interest.
But Schiller’s most noteworthy exercises in this direction have,
I believe, been generally thought to be the æsthetic discourses
of the Fourteenth volume<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c010'><sup>[741]</sup></a> and those on “Naïve and Sentimental
Poetry,”<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c010'><sup>[742]</sup></a> and on “The Sublime” in the Fifteenth.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Bürger review.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This also contains the few reviews preserved. Of these, the
most remarkable is the unlucky one on Bürger, as to which
I can only say that, having first read it when I
had not read A. W. Schlegel’s reply,<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c010'><sup>[743]</sup></a> and did not
know the tenor of this, I had anticipated Schlegel’s verdict,
that it is “an offence against literary morality.” In one case,
therefore, however humble, Schiller’s later plea,<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c010'><sup>[744]</sup></a> that posterity
would do justice to the uprightness of his intentions, has not
itself been justified: and I cannot think that it can have been
so in many others. For, though the ill side of human nature
will always rejoice in its own likeness, and though, even
putting this aside, there is still a singular notion abroad that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>an abusive review must be an honest and well-intentioned
one, <em>this</em> review is one of the worst ever written, and in one
of its own latter sentences it writes itself down so. Bürger,
we are told, has “wealth of poetical painting, the glowing and
energetic language of the heart, a streamer of poetry, now
waving gorgeously, now caressingly floating, and [finally] an
honest heart that speaks from every line.” If it were possible
to imagine a reader who did not know <cite>Lenore</cite> or anything of the
rest, and who had worked patiently through the pages on pages
of carping and sneering which lead up to this astonishing confession,
we can only suppose that he would gasp for breath,
and wonder whether he had turned over half a dozen sheets
at once and come upon the end of a quite different paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth appears to be that Schiller, with all his talent,
all his genius, was something of a prig: and a prig is capable
of almost any discreditable act. It has often been pointed
out that for the author of <span lang="de"><cite>Die Räuber</cite></span> to find fault with Bürger
as not being strictly proper is “rather too rich”: but it must
be remembered that when Schiller wrote <span lang="de"><cite>Die Räuber</cite></span> he was
a prig too, though a prig in a fit of unconventional, Bohemian,
and <span lang="de"><i>Sturm-und-Drang</i></span> priggishness. <em>Here</em> the cold fit had
followed the hot. The poet of the Moors is now busied
with “the man of culture,” with “Idealising art which collects
and mirrors all the morality, all the character, all the wisdom
of the time,” and which of course rejects equally raptures
about “Molly,” and childish things about the dead riding fast.
He informs us, with the true superior air, that Bürger “not
seldom mingles with the People, to whom he should only let
himself condescend.” And he has succeeded, marvellous to say,
in reducing <span lang="la"><i>ad absurdum</i></span> the argument against popularity as
a test of poetry, in his very endeavour to reduce thereto the
argument <em>for</em> it. “’Tis as much as to say,” cries he with lofty
scorn, “‘What pleases excellent judges is good: what pleases
all without distinction is better.’” “Why, so it is, oh well-born
Court-Counsellor and Professor at Jena,” one may reply.<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c010'><sup>[745]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span></div>
<a id='sec8.3.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Xenien.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span>, I am afraid I am still more out of accord
with Schiller’s admirers here. The ill-nature of them is very
suspicious when we find that, in this collaboration,
it communicated itself to Goethe, who was certainly
not ill-natured as a rule, though he was rather selfish. But
the ill-nature is not the worst part. This kind of thing,
whether it is done by a Pope, or by a Firm of Goethe, Schiller,
&#38; Company, has some of the disgustfulness of pigeon-shooting
or even rabbit-coursing. There is hardly any real sport
in it; the victims are nearly always rather defenceless, and
generally quite harmless: their destruction does little, if any,
good to anybody; and the spectacle is demoralising.<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c010'><sup>[746]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span>, I confess, appear to me to be one of those
superstitions of literature which it is certainly the business of
the critic, and the historian of Criticism, to protest against and
demolish if he can. I never thought very much of them: and
I think still less of them after a very careful study for the
purposes of this book.<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c010'><sup>[747]</sup></a> They corresponded, of course, in a
certain sense, to the nearly contemporary, but much less famous
and, as far as their authors are concerned, much less remarkable
<span lang="fr"><i>battues</i></span> of Rivarol and Gifford in France and England.
Goethe and Schiller were not only much more formidable
sportsmen, but had much better game—or worse vermin if
anybody likes—for quarry. The imperfections of German literature
were, as they always have been, much greater than those
of French, and much more easily got at than those of English.
It is rather ridiculous, and more than rather disgusting, to find
even such men treating such others as Wieland and Jean Paul
(Herder himself seems only to have escaped because of his
personal connection with Weimar) as if they were “Tom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Sternhold or Tom Shadwell.” But this is not the worst of it.
The <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span> are not, as a rule or in any large proportion,
particularly <em>good</em>: and if they did not appeal to the ill-nature
of mankind, and had not great names attached to them, few
people would think them so. Schiller’s are often very lumbering
verse and phrase, regarded merely as phrase and verse:
Goethe’s are less often so, but seldom very brilliant as either.<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c010'><sup>[748]</sup></a>
If more people would read them in comparison with Martial
himself, their lameness and awkwardness could hardly fail
to be made clear. It would need a rather wider reading
(though I at least have as little doubt of the result) to show
not merely their pervading ill-nature and arrogance but their
frequent miss-fires.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Correspondence with Goethe.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Most fortunately, however, we are not left either in the cold
with the Æsthetic treatises, or in hot water with the Bürger
review and the <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span>. The <cite>Letters of Schiller and
Goethe</cite><a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c010'><sup>[749]</sup></a> are a twice-blest book. Nowhere does one
<em>like</em> Goethe so much as in them: nowhere is it possible
to understand, and therefore to like, Schiller better than
in parts of them. It is true that the sense of his being fundamentally
a prig of genius remains—that even the sense of his
having something of that “bad blood,” of which Milton, Racine,
and perhaps Wordsworth, are the chief other examples among
persons of genius of the Upper House, remains likewise. But
Goethe meets him with such an amiable <span lang="fr"><i>camaraderie</i></span>, he
softens his asperities with such a never offensive but always
effective blend of cordiality and irony, that, after the first few
letters, Schiller begins to talk almost like a man of this world,
and yet neither loses his predominant interest in literature.
It is true that when we come to the <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span> the offence returns.
It is not pleasant to find two men of genius calmly plotting
how to put, into the smallest space and the neatest form, most
envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>greatest number of persons obnoxious to them. And Schiller’s
remarks on the necessity of “giving it hot” to a certain
unlucky Reichardt, who had had the impudence not merely to
praise the <span lang="de"><cite>Horen</cite></span> lukewarmly, but to praise the wrong things
in them, can only be matched with Macaulay in reference to
Croker, while there is much more deliberate malice in them.
It is no excuse to say that severe criticisms are sometimes
necessary. The reviewer is a policeman who may sometimes
have to use his staff: the <span lang="de"><cite>Xenien</cite></span>-writer is a bravo who chooses
the stiletto. But enough of that matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>And, as has been said, the book as a whole is very interesting
to us. Schiller’s criticisms on <span lang="de"><cite>Meister</cite></span> never reach the concentrated
justice of Novalis (<i>v. inf.</i>) But they are by no means
without <span lang="la"><i>parrhesia</i></span>: and the picture they give us of the successive
results of the instalments, on an eagerly receptive and
extraordinarily sensitive literary wit-gauge, is not readily to be
paralleled, except by the companion remarks of Goethe on <span lang="de"><cite>Wallenstein</cite></span>
later. And Goethe’s practised <span lang="de"><cite>Weltweisheit</cite></span> deprives his
observations of the naïve character which Schiller always, for
good or for bad, retains. The latter, however, always retains
likewise his porcupine attitude towards contemporary men of
letters who are not quite of “ours.” From Richter to
Bouterwek he cannot away with them in one sense, and would
like to away with them very much in the other. Where this
disturbing element does not come in, he is better; but seldom
quite satisfactory. He was right not to think much of Darwin,
and not wrong to think something of Restif’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Monsieur Nicolas</cite></span>:
but this last, at least, has little to do with literature. His
Shakespeare criticisms are always informing from the ethical-æsthetic
side; they hardly even attempt the literary. But the
elaborate character of the Index to these letters, which exhibits
all the literary judgments of both the poets under separate
reasoned catalogues, makes it almost unnecessary to pursue our
usual process of sampling, the task being done to hand.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Naïve and Sentimental Poetry.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of the definite critical treatises, by far the most important
for our purpose (the “Æsthetic Education” being omitted, on
the showing of its chief admirers, as of a more general bearing)
is the tract on “Naïve and Sentimental Poetry.” It has even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>been claimed for this, that here, for the first time, is a distinction
made out between ancient and modern
poets, on the score of their objective and subjective
character respectively. The distinction is not
quite real, and it is not critically made out. In
support of the first demurrer (which is something too wide for
us here), let me request anybody who really knows the Greek
choruses, and especially those of Æschylus, to say whether, on
his soul and conscience, he can deny them “sentimentality” in
the good sense, subjectivity in any. Goethe and Browning will
be hard put to it to fight this prize against the choruses of the
<cite>Agamemnon</cite> alone. The other point is more relevant. At
the time<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c010'><sup>[750]</sup></a> when Schiller wrote this essay we know, from a
subsequent letter of his<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c010'><sup>[751]</sup></a> to Goethe, that he had not read the
<cite>Poetics</cite>; this is dangerous, but it is not fatal. What is, as it
seems to me, fatal is that nearly all his literary citations are of
a general and second-hand character. I can see nowhere any
direct evidence of “contact” with the texts. He knows Kant
at first hand certainly; he probably knows Lessing and Herder;
he of course knows Kleist and Wieland. But did he know, at
first hand and in the originals, besides the ancients, Shakespeare
and Milton, Dante and Ariosto, Rabelais and Molière?
I cannot see much evidence of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fact, though I know well to what danger I am, once more,
exposing myself, I must once more say that Schiller does not
seem to me a great critic, or even a good one. He was a man
of letters who, as such, possessed genius, and a philosopher who
at least had a very great talent for philosophy; and so much
of a critic as can be made by these two qualifications he was.
To put it in other ways, and perhaps to go even a little further,
he was, as a merely <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> critic, or a critic furnished with
such <span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> knowledge as can be supplied at second-hand,
very clever indeed. He could spin out of his interior more
criticism, and of a better quality, than most men could. But
he was excessively deficient in Love—that first and greatest
fulfilling of the law of the true critic: and, partly without his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>own fault (for, as is well known, his life was short and not
altogether favoured by fortune), partly by it, he did not give
himself, or was not given, sufficient opportunity to warm his
hands before that immortal fire of literature which each generation
keeps burning, to soften what is harsh, feed what is
starved, anoint and cheer and clean what is stiffened and
saddened and soiled in the nature of man. The best of life
might yet have been for him in criticism, as in other things:
the <span lang="de"><cite>Versöhnung</cite></span>, the time of the “calmed and calming <span lang="la"><i>mens
adepta</i></span>,” might have come. But it did not so please the
Gods; and the most illogical form of playing Providence
perhaps, though not the most mischievous and impertinent,
is to refuse to accept the fact of what the Gods did <em>not</em> choose
to do.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Others: Bürger.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Others of the greatest men of this Augustan period of German
literature were more or less given to criticism, while not
deriving their chief titles from it. Bürger himself
was not at all contemptible in this respect. His
answer to Schiller<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c010'><sup>[752]</sup></a> is not undignified, and a little more of
that wisdom of the serpent, which Molly’s adorer never possessed,
would have made it very damaging. As we have said,
it was Schiller’s ridicule of his theory of popularity that was
ridiculous, not the theory in itself: and several things worth
attention will be found in the two <cite>Prefaces</cite> to his <cite>Poems</cite>, in
his “Thoughts on translating Homer,” and in his Prose Fragments.
In these last, indeed, there are some critical utterances
of real weight on the extreme sensuous and individualist side
of theoretical Poetic. Bürger says boldly that “among people
to whom asafœtida gives a more charming scent than roses
the poet ought to celebrate asafœtida”; and I am bound to
say I think he is right.<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c010'><sup>[753]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Richter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There is a note to the Preface of the second edition of Jean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Paul’s<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c010'><sup>[754]</sup></a> <span lang="de"><cite>Vorschule der Æsthetik</cite></span> which expresses my own opinions
on its subject so completely that I must give it in
full. “A collection of Wieland’s reviews in the
<span lang="de"><cite>Teutsche Merkur</cite></span>, or, in short, any honest selection of the best
æsthetic reviews from newspapers and periodicals, would be a
better bargain for the artist than any newest <cite>Æsthetic</cite>. In
every good review there is, hidden or revealed, a good
'Æsthetic,' and, more than that, an applied one, and a free,
and the shortest of all, and (by dint of the examples)
the best.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No one, of course, who has the slightest knowledge of Richter
will suppose that the whole book is written in such a straight-forward
and common-sense style as this. But it is very far
indeed from being one of his thorniest or most acrobatical: and
Carlyle<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c010'><sup>[755]</sup></a> need scarcely have feared that it might “astonish
many an honest brother of our craft were he to read it,
and altogether perplex and dash his maturest counsels if he
chanced to understand it.” Nobody who can understand the
<span lang="la"><cite>Biographia Litteraria</cite></span> could have the faintest difficulty with
the <span lang="de"><cite>Vorschule</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="de">Vorschule der Æsthetik.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Such Richterisms as do appear are chiefly in the appendix
lectures, the “<span lang="de"><cite>Miserikordia</cite></span>-Lecture for Stylists,” the “<span lang="de"><cite>Jubilate</cite></span>-Lecture
for Poetical Persons,” and the “<span lang="de"><cite>Kantate</cite></span>-Lecture
on  Poetical  Poetry,” which, nevertheless, do
contain excellent things. In the main body of the
book there are only occasional flings (such as, “according to
Kant, the formation of the heavenly bodies is easier to deduce
than the formation of a caterpillar”), while the famous and very
just description of a certain thing as “like a lighthouse, high,
shining, empty,” is mere justice lighted up itself by wit. The
fact is, that the book is one of the best of its kind, and deserves
to be reserved from that exclusion of titular Æsthetics which
prevails in this part of our History, not more by the large
intermixture of actual criticism in it than by the sanity, combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>with inspiration, of the rest. From its separation at the
beginning of the “Nihilists” of Poetry (those who generalise
everything) and the Materialists (who abide wholly in the
sensuous) to the fragments on Style and Language at the end,
it is a really excellent book, and if it has not been translated
into English it ought to have been, and to be.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The so-called “Romantic School.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The German “Romantic School”<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c010'><sup>[756]</sup></a> has been the occasion of
divers solid books<a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c010'><sup>[757]</sup></a> (and famous booklets) all to itself, and I do
not consider it necessary to say much about it
generally here. In a certain justifiable sense it
may be said to have begun with Klopstock and
only died, if it died even then, with Heine, who, on a calculus
to me, I own, incomprehensible in any other sense than this,
is thought by some to have killed it. But its usual connotation
in literary histories, a connotation responsible, I think, for this
and other errors, is that of a period extending from the latest
years of the eighteenth century over about the first quarter (or
the first thirty or forty years) of the nineteenth, and dominated
by a remarkable quartette of friends—the two younger
Schlegels, “Novalis,” and Tieck. The work of all the four
is saturated with literary criticism of the polemic and propagandist
kind, but it is rendered more troublesome to handle
than it need be by the pestilent habit (which the Germans
took from Rousseau, and from Goethe downwards indulged
after the most intemperate fashion) of throwing polemic and
propagandist thought into the forms of prose romance.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Novalis.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of these four the <em>greatest</em> critic is, in my humble judgment,
Novalis—though he wrote the least criticism. Indeed, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>is a sense in which one might, without absurdity, call Novalis
the greatest critic of Germany. He is, in fact, the Shelley of
criticism; and it may be left to the Devil’s Advocates
to suggest that, like Shelley, he had time to
indicate, at least, all that was of truth in him, and had no
time to turn it into, or muddle it with, error. He, very much
more than Jean Paul, is <span lang="de"><i>der Einzige</i></span>: though his uniqueness is
such that, while it does not adjust itself to all times or
temperaments, it will, when once apprehended, always re-present
itself at some time or other with some slight assistance of
fortune.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would hardly have assisted his critical position if he had
carried out the intention, which we are told<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c010'><sup>[758]</sup></a> he entertained
(under the influence of the above-noted delusion, as to the

which (see below) he judged so well, would have had much
to answer for if this had been done. As it is, the existing
but unfinished <span lang="de"><cite>Heinrich von Ofterdingen</cite></span> represents the first
of these, and the not much more than begun <span lang="de"><cite>Lehrlinge zu

bodiless and in the gloom. It was much better so:
for neither the partly completed nor the hardly begun book
approaches in value the <span lang="de"><cite>Fragmente</cite></span> which follow. In fact,
even if the scheme were really practicable (which, despite
certain imposing instances, may be very much doubted), it is
pretty clear that Friedrich von Hardenberg was not the man
for it.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Heinrich.</div>

<p class='c001'>It can hardly, on the other hand, rejoice any reader of
<span lang="de"><cite>Heinrich von Ofterdingen</cite></span>, whether he be philosopher, critic, or
simple reader for reading’s sake, when the Quest
of the Blue Flower, and all the other agreeable
Fouqué-like “swarmeries,” are interrupted by a discourse of
three pages from the poet Klingsohr on the <span lang="de"><cite>Überschwenglichkeit</cite></span>
of certain subjects for poetry. Even if you are a poet, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>Middle-High-German, and the father of Matilda, you must not
talk like that in a novel. And your poetry, and your Middle-High-Germanship,
and your fatherhood of Matilda are very
distinctly <span lang="de"><cite>überschwenglich</cite></span> for you in your character as a critic.
From Heinrich, therefore, we shall chiefly get (though there
are tempting <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> in it here and there) a somewhat vague
notion of the <span lang="fr"><i>clair-de-lune</i></span> Poetic of the central Romantic
school. <a id='sec8.3.39'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The earlier</i> Fragments.</span> The <cite>Disciples at Sais</cite> hardly concern us. But the
<cite>Fragments</cite> that remain give much less unsubstantial food.
Here is that witty and appallingly accurate judgment
of Klopstock, which applies to a whole class
of poets as well, that “His works appear to be, for the most
part, free translations and workings up of an unknown Poet by
a very talented but unpoetical philologist.” Here, too, is that
remarkable judgment of Goethe’s work in general, and of
<span lang="de"><cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite></span> in particular, of which Carlyle bravely gave
the gist,<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c010'><sup>[759]</sup></a> though it certainly did not coincide with his own
opinion, and which remains almost a pattern of independent
and solid judgment, unspoilt by any petulance or jealousy of
youth, from a young man of letters on the living leader of his
country’s literature. Here also are some almost equally remarkable
things on Shakespeare, not quite showing the
<em>adequacy</em><a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c010'><sup>[760]</sup></a> of those on Goethe, but very acute and especially
valuable because they enter a protest against the exaggeration—a
reaction, of course, from the opposite exaggeration of
Voltaire &#38; Co.—of Shakespeare’s deliberate artistry. And
these individual judgments occur side by side, in the æsthetic
and literary division of these <cite>Fragments</cite>, with more general
dicta of astonishing profundity and beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most pregnant of all the sayings, as it seems to me,
though the æstheticians may not like it, is this,<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c010'><sup>[761]</sup></a> “Æsthetic is
absolutely independent of Poetry”; and I should pair with it
the other,<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c010'><sup>[762]</sup></a> “May not poetry be nothing but <em>inner</em> painting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>music, freely modified by the nature of [the individual’s?] feeling
(<span lang="de">Gemüth</span>)?” The further Shakespearian remarks<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c010'><sup>[763]</sup></a> on the
blending of contradictories in our poet, with the remarkable
approximation of his style to Boccaccio’s and Cervantes’ prose,
as <span lang="de">“gründlich, elegant, nett, <em>pedantisch</em> und vollständig,”</span> may
puzzle some people, but they do not puzzle me. What a critical
genius must a German have had who, about 1800 and before
he himself was thirty, combined<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c010'><sup>[764]</sup></a> with the above-cited judgments
of Klopstock and Goethe, recognition of the facts that
Wieland and Richter sin from formlessness, and from having
“not æsthetic or comic <em>spirit</em>, but only æsthetic or comic <em>moods</em>,”
<em>and</em> that Schiller “starts from too definite a point, and draws
in too sharp and hard an outline.” <span lang="de">“Man ist allein mit allem
was man liebt”</span><a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c010'><sup>[765]</sup></a> may be said, by any one who likes, to be mere
“dropping into poetry” in feeling as in form. Again: it is
not so to me. And the postil<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c010'><sup>[766]</sup></a> on a highly aggressive text,
<span lang="de">“Die Welt muss <em>romanticisirt</em> werden,”</span> is not so aggressive as
it looks.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.40'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The later.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I am, however, inclined to think that there is still further
improvement in the fragments and thoughts of the <em>third</em>
volume. This was not published till nearly twenty
years after Carlyle wrote the Essay by which, in all
probability, most Englishmen know Novalis. But I should
venture to recommend, to any one who wishes to understand
him, the reading of it both first and last. The biographical
article, written many years before by his old friend and chief,
Just, gives, I think, a fuller and truer notion of the man than
Tieck’s <span lang="de"><cite>Vorrede</cite></span> in the first collection. The Diaries, Letters,
and oddments of various kinds help to fill out this portrait,
and the <span lang="de"><cite>Fragmente</cite></span>, themselves, from p. 160 onward, contain
most admirable things. This third volume, in fact, forms a
much earlier pendant to Amiel’s <cite>Journal</cite>, with, as some people
may be excused for thinking, much less <span lang="de"><i>Katzenjammer</i></span>, a much
manlier tone, and far more positive genius.</p>

<p class='c001'>How much more critical and more informing is the confession<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c010'><sup>[767]</sup></a>
that “Shakespeare is darker to him than Greece”—that
he is more at home with Aristophanes’ jokes than with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Shakespeare’s—not merely than the old abuse, but than certain
kinds of laudation! What a combination (on a par with the
sentence on Klopstock, elsewhere cited) of <span lang="it"><i>giustizia</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>potestate</i></span>,
<span lang="it"><i>sapienzia</i></span>, <span lang="it"><i>e amore</i></span> (not a bad definition, by the way, if I may
dare to borrow it, of the qualifications of the critic) is there in
the saying<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c010'><sup>[768]</sup></a> that Goethe is <span lang="de">“der wahre <em>Statthalter</em> des Poetischen
Geistes auf Erden”</span>! The words—idle paradox as they may
seem to some—“Moments may occur when A B C books and
Compendia seem to us poetical,”<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c010'><sup>[769]</sup></a> are a better text for a whole
æsthetic—or, at least, for a whole theory of real criticism—than
<span lang="la"><i>oratio sensitiva perfecta</i></span> or any of its clan. So is this:<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c010'><sup>[770]</sup></a>
“By industrious and intelligent study of the classics of the
Ancients, there arises for us a classical literature which the
Ancients themselves had not.” How just the observation<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c010'><sup>[771]</sup></a>
that “Lessing saw too clearly: and so missed the feeling of
the <em>undefined</em> Whole”!</p>

<a id='sec8.3.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His critical magic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These are but specimens. But I shall venture to say of
them that for awaking the critical power, and qualifying the
critical taste where it exists—as examples of that
critical unity of subject and object which has
been so often spoken of—they are specimens of some significance.
There is only one other person who can, I
think, be yoked with Friedrich von Hardenberg. If you
want critical system, range of actual critical examination,
and the like, you must go elsewhere. But for critical
<em>magic</em>—for the critical “Open sesame!”—go to the two contemporaries,
Novalis and Joubert.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.42'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Tieck.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Tieck, at one time very famous as a critic, and not undeservedly
so, need occupy us less than his friends: for he has
less intensity than Novalis, and less extension than
the Schlegels. Survey of his critical work may,
therefore, with advantage be confined to the actual collection
of his <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Schriften</cite></span>,<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c010'><sup>[772]</sup></a> which he issued in his last years:
for the <span lang="de"><cite>Nachgelassene Schriften</cite></span>,<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c010'><sup>[773]</sup></a> the two thin volumes of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>appeared after his death, contain only an eristic or apologetic
piece, <span lang="de">“Über Parteilichkeit, Dummheit, und Bosheit”</span>—an
<span lang="de">“<em>un</em>hübsches Lied”</span> which we all feel inclined to sing now and
then—and some fragments and sketches for his great projected
Shakespeare-book. It need hardly be said that Tieck occupies
a very important position in the succession of German Shakespeare
critics, or that some of the most interesting of his criticisms
belong to the subject. Three out of the four earliest
articles of the <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Schriften</cite></span>, all dated before 1800, concern
the Master—the first being a perhaps excusably ill-tempered
one on the engravings of the too famous Shakespeare
Gallery; the second, the really valuable discussion of his
“Handling of the Marvellous”; and the third, “Letters” on
him. Tieck, as is again matter of common knowledge, was
an early student of the Pre-Shakespearian drama, dealing with
it at intervals in 1811, 1823, and 1828. His criticism is generally
appreciative: but his textual suggestions are not always
fortunate.<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c010'><sup>[774]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As an example of what may be called the Romantic <span lang="fr"><i>potpourri</i></span>,
Tieck’s work is very interesting and symptomatic. It
ranges from Early German drama through Kleist to Goethe
at home, and from Espinel to the history of the <em>Novella</em> abroad.
It is all sensitive, appreciative, catholic; and there is a remarkably
sound sense of Literary History (which it must be
remembered was still in its infancy) in an article on “Criticism
and German Bookishness” (<span lang="de"><i>Buchwesen</i></span>). On the whole, however,
that subordinate position, from the historical point of
view, which I have assigned to him, in comparison with the
other members of the quartette, seems to me not unjustifiable.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.43'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Schlegels.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There are not many better known names in the History of
Criticism than those of the (younger) Schlegels. They may
even be said to be, in a vague and general manner,
more associated with the idea of “Romantic” criticism
than any other persons: and the question of the exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>relationship of both to Coleridge, or of Coleridge to them, is
one of those which seem to have more power than anything
else to conciliate the attention to critical persons, though, as
has been confessed repeatedly, the attraction is rather repulsive
to the present writer. Of their influence on Madame de Staël—who
at least served as a most influential vulgariser of the
new critical ideas in Europe—there is no question at all: the
later critical Corinne is mainly, if not merely, as much Schlegel
as could go clothed in French petticoats, and remember itself
there. Those who adopt the common, but to my thinking quite
erroneous, idea that Romanticism began to wane towards the
middle of the nineteenth century, or even earlier, probably mean
Schlegelian Romanticism, and are so, perhaps, not quite wrong.
In any case, the name, if shadowy and in a sense antiquated, is
still imposing, if only as having once imposed.<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c010'><sup>[775]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.44'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their general position and drift.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The work of the Schlegels generally—for not a little of it
was done in common, and almost all expresses a common
tendency—may be described as a continuation of
that of Herder, with a still more definitely literary
intent, and with what may be called a <em>complexion</em>
to that intent which was most definite of all.
Criticism in Germany had been a long time focussing itself,
and it may perhaps even be questioned whether the period
of actual focus which it had now reached lasted very long;
but for a time it did last. The somewhat wool-gathering and
tentative efforts of Bodmer and his school had started the
movement: and those of Gottsched, with, in a less utterly
perverse direction, those of the half-French school—of whom
Wieland is the representative, “too good for such a breed”—had
wholly failed to divert it; the keen-edged strength of
Lessing had given it movement and penetration; the immense
literary excursions of Herder and others had opened up the
widest fields to it. Nay, the Æsthetics, from Baumgarten to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Schiller, with the imminent or accomplished transcendence
of their transcendentalism in the minds, if not yet on the
pens, of such men as Fichte and Hegel, had in a dangerous
balloon-like fashion given new motive and vehicle; and the
amiable if excessive Chauvinism of those about Klopstock
had its good side likewise. If the extraordinary critical insight
and sureness of hand which we have seen in the fragments
of Novalis could have been allowed to preside over the
concentration of all these, and had taken into partnership the
practical wisdom of Goethe, and the exact scholarship of the
great German school of philologists from Reiske downwards,
there is no knowing how great the things done in consequence
might have been. As it was, these two friends of Novalis were
not quite equal to so mighty a task: but they did what they
could, and it was a good deal.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.45'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Characteristiken.</div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, Carlyle, I think, showed a right <em>flair</em>, due
not merely to the fact that he had probably made his own
first acquaintance with them in it, by selecting the
<span lang="de"><cite>Characteristiken</cite></span><a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c010'><sup>[776]</sup></a> as more than titularly characteristic.
No matter what article we take, or which brother,
the eulogies of Lessing and of Meister, or the apology for
Bürger, the “Romeo and Juliet,” an admirable thing in all
but its title,<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c010'><sup>[777]</sup></a> or the capital “Letters on Poetry” (in which
A. W., unhampered by the connection with a heretic on the
subject which afterwards hampered Coleridge, puts the indissolubility
of the marriage between metre and poetry with the
greatest force), the “Bluebeard and Puss in Boots,” or the
“Don Quixote,” there is noticeable, in all, the peculiar modern
blend of criticism—moral, æsthetic, verbal, and purely literary—compounded
and applied with the utmost freshness, vigour,
and skill. I do not know that they ever did better work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>though, no doubt, there is observable, here as elsewhere, the
great fault of Romantic criticism generally—that the critic is,
so to say, too much at the mercy of the last speaker. The
actual goose, on pool or grass, is always not only a swan, but
<em>the</em> swan. Shakespeare and Calderon, Indian Literature and
Chamfort, rule the <a id='corr394.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='roast'>roost</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_394.6'><ins class='correction' title='roast'>roost</ins></a></span> so absolutely and exclusively for the
time that one has twinges and qualms of doubt as to the
legitimacy of the kinghood of any one of them.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.46'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>A. W.: the</i> <span lang="de">Kritische Schriften</span> <i>of</i> 1828.</div>

<p class='c001'>But henceforward we may separate the brothers for a moment
and take the elder first. His <span lang="de"><cite>Kritische Schriften</cite></span>, mentioned
in the note above, have the advantage, which it is
nearly impossible to exaggerate, of containing not
merely reviews and critical writings of different
periods, but also later annotations on the earlier
ones.<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c010'><sup>[778]</sup></a> There can be no better test of a man’s critical quality
than this: and Schlegel comes out of it very well, though the
result no doubt does not place him quite as high as his friend
Corinne and some others would do. The two best examples
are the long and early review of Voss’s Homer,<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c010'><sup>[779]</sup></a> and that
(later but still early) of Bürger’s <cite>Poems</cite>. There is perhaps a
slightly excessive patriotism in the author’s contention that
German is better suited than any other language for the
purpose of translating Homer; one is almost tempted to echo
Garrick to Goldsmith: “Come, come! you are perhaps the
worst ... eh, eh?” in certain respects, though no doubt not
in all. Yet even here there is force as well as ingenuity in
the contention that the very fact of Germany possessing no
large amount of great literature at the time prevented German
phrase from being hackneyed in, and, as it were, <em>ascript</em> to, certain
contexts and associations, as was the case with Italian, French,
and even English, while the enormous and unquestioned xenomania
with which the Germans had for generations
been refreshing and stocking their speech and their
culture was another advantage.<a id='sec8.3.47'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>On Voss.</i></span> There is, moreover, too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>distinct animus against Pope as a coryphæus of the English
Neo-classics; but this itself marks Schlegel’s attitude, which, let
it be remembered, was fresh and novel. Nor is it surprising
that, as the author tells us with pride, both Goethe and
Schiller, personages not always well disposed to him, warmly
approved the metrical part of the essay. It is now pretty
generally admitted, both that Schlegel was a very sound critic
on this all-important subject, and that the importance of it
was almost greater in Germany than elsewhere owing to the
extreme laxity and cacophony, descending at times nearly to
the level of the horse-fiddle, in which men not merely like
Klopstock but like Bürger had indulged. And the whole is
one of the first examples I know of a full modern review of
the best kind, neither “puff” nor “slate” (though there is a
good deal of severe criticism in it), neither mere <span lang="fr"><i>compte-rendu</i></span>
nor mere divagation from the subject into some general discussion
which happens to interest the reviewer.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.48'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Bürger.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Bürger article<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c010'><sup>[780]</sup></a> has the additional interest of being an
answer, and a crushing one, to a precedent criticism. I have
said<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c010'><sup>[781]</sup></a> something earlier of Schiller’s unlucky production,
and need not return to it: but it may
fairly be observed that this is as good an instance of obedience
to literary morality as that was of offence against it. Bürger
had been a friend of Schlegel’s, and he was one of the poetical
protagonists of the cause for which Schlegel himself was fighting.
Yet there is no unfair praise here: and, what is more,
there is no abstinence from just censure. Indeed Schlegel
may be thought to be even a little too hard on the unlucky
<span lang="de"><cite>Lenardo und Blandine</cite></span>, though this piece has nearly all the
faults of “Monk” Lewis and other imitators.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, however, these and other pieces of themselves place
Schlegel in a high position as a critic, the volumes do not fail
to show his shortcomings. The system of self-annotation,
though possessing some advantages, is dangerous, as giving
opportunity for those egotistical displays of which Schlegel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>has been commonly accused: but this does not matter so very
much. <a id='sec8.3.49'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The</i> Urtheile, <i>&#38;c.</i></span> The batch of <span lang="de"><cite>Urtheile</cite></span>, <span lang="de"><cite>Gedanken</cite></span>, &#38;c., which closes the
first volume, and which originally appeared in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
(the periodical which the two brothers had founded
in 1798, the very year of the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite><a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c010'><sup>[782]</sup></a>), do
not raise our opinion of Schlegel’s talent, and they
certainly do not, as do the corresponding <cite>Fragments</cite> of Novalis,
give us any idea of critical genius. The one exception<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c010'><sup>[783]</sup></a> is not
at all like the others, and <em>is</em> very like Novalis himself. But
even this is rather an amusing and well-aimed “fling” than
a real critical plummet suddenly let down to the bottom of
the well of critical Truth. The rest are quite ordinary and
commonplace things, by no means unrespectable but nothing
more. Now, no one is bound to isolate his critical judgments
and set them up in specimen-cases for examination after this
fashion. But if he does so, they should be something more
than commonplace, and ordinary, and respectable.<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c010'><sup>[784]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec8.3.50'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="de">Vorlesungen über Dramatische Kunst und Literatur.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that Schlegel’s best-known work is, as
sometimes, though not always, happens, his best, and by a very
long way. The <cite>Lectures on Dramatic Art and
Literature</cite>, which he delivered at Vienna in 1808,
printed next year, and issued finally in book form
three years later, undoubtedly deserve a place, not
merely in any library of critical literature, but on
any shelf devoted to criticism which will hold, say, a score of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>volumes. They have indeed faults, and grave ones. The
attitude towards French Drama, and especially towards Corneille
and Molière, does not sin merely by an excess of party
spirit. There would be some excuse for that, especially in face
of the absolutely ridiculous over-valuation of themselves by the
French, who had held the critical ear of Europe for a hundred
and fifty years. Moreover, as has been, I think, hinted more
than once here, there are worse things than thorough-going
advocacy, prosecuting as well as defending, in criticism, provided
only that it observes literary manners and literary morals, that
it is well informed, and that it is intelligent. Schlegel is not
exactly guilty under the first count, but he is under the two
last. He ought to have seen that Corneille is really a Romantic
Samson in the mill of the classical Gaza. And as to Molière
the case is even worse. Further, to confine ourselves to really
large and important matters, the complete omission of the
mediæval drama in the earlier part of the book, where we
stride straight from Seneca to the Renaissance, and the very
inadequate treatment of it later, form a really serious draw-back.
I have myself little doubt that the almost incomprehensible
blunder of those who deny the influence of this
mediæval drama on our Elizabethans, is in some cases due to
the blunderers having taken their notions on the subject from
Schlegel. And it would be extremely easy to pick out a
small number of great errors, and a great number of small
ones, to supplement these two.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.51'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their initial and other merit.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet they are but little to be considered—they are certainly
not to be considered as at all fatal—in face of the merits
of the book. To me the greatest of all these is
contained in its very first page, where the whole
question of the kinds, or parts, or phases of criticism,
and of their relation to each other, is treated with a completeness
and sureness which I do not know where to find
before, and which I wish I had found oftener since. On
the one hand, says Schlegel, there is the general <cite>History</cite>
of Art—indispensable, but not always easy to understand. On
the other, there is the <em>Theory</em> of Art in general, and the arts
in particular—extremely important to the philosopher, necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>to some extent for the artist himself, but inadequate by
itself. Between these two, connecting them, completing them,
making them fruitful, is actual criticism—the comparison and
judging of existing productions. There is really little or nothing
to add to this: and if no other line of the book had ever been
written, it would give Schlegel an abiding and important place
in our history. But the book itself, though necessarily in other
parts somewhat antiquated, though of the kind which has to
be done afresh for itself, if not by every generation yet by
every century or so, remains excellent and masterly—one of
the best individual summaries of the critical struggle for
independence of the eighteenth century, and by no means
merely dead or exhausted after the end of the nineteenth.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.52'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Schlegelian position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We should draw from this book the idea that though Goethe’s
contemptuous dismissal of August von Schlegel (almost in
his presence) as <span lang="de"><i>kein Mann</i></span><a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c010'><sup>[785]</sup></a> is not borne out by
it in the critical respect,—though the accompanying
compensation-prize of “learning and service” to
literature certainly <em>is</em>—there remains to be added, if in
the favourable sense an acknowledgment of the completeness,
and value of his playing of his part, and of the part itself,
yet also a further limitation. We have seen and acknowledged
the truth throughout, though we have protested against the
common exaggeration of it, that “old critics are like old
moons.” Perhaps the Schlegels are the most eminent examples
of this. They did yeoman’s service in their own time and
to their own country—perhaps even at that time they did
service to other countries, too, in preaching and spreading the
Romantic gospel. But they were diffusers and popularisers,
not origins: and they did not give to their diffusion and
popularisation quite that touch of pure literary genius which
will save anything and anybody. They thus rank rather with
Addison among ourselves than with Dryden or Johnson,
though in thoroughness and width of critical knowledge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>practice they are ahead of all three. If I were writing this
History of Criticism in German, and for Germans, I should
give them much more space than I give them here, of course.
But even if I were a German, “writing on this German matter
in the German tongue for German men,” I should never put
them on a level with Coleridge, any more than I should with
Aristotle or Longinus in one class of critics, with Novalis or
with Joubert in another.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.53'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> <span lang="de">Vorlesungen über Schöne Literatur und Kunst</span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The long unpublished Berlin <cite>Lectures on Art and Belles
Lettres</cite>, in the three first years of the nineteenth century,
supply a document of A. W. Schlegel’s criticism
which is of the very greatest value. It is true
that they are “half-done work”—in some cases
bare notes for lectures, in others detached pieces
of them, in only a very few (which were separately published)
finished even as parts. But it would be very unwise of a
writer to put his readers, and very unbenevolent of readers
to put their author, in either of the two classes to whom “half-done
work” is taboo. In fact, the book is as much finished
as not a few of the contemporary documents for Coleridge:
and its great bulk and very extensive range promise well
enough. Nor is the performance to be evil spoken of. Ambitious
as is his scope, Schlegel nowhere shows that shyness
of detail which we shall have to notice in his brother: and
his width of knowledge, which would be unusual even at the
present day, is quite astounding when we remember that it
was shown by a man of not much over thirty a hundred years
ago. The first volume, or course, deals with Æsthetics generally,
though from a peculiar point of view: and only a few things
in it need be noted, the most remarkable of which is Schlegel’s
scorn for Longinus on the one hand,<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c010'><sup>[786]</sup></a> and on the other his
very ample acknowledgment of the dangers of Æsthetics themselves.<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c010'><sup>[787]</sup></a>
The second deals with Ancient Literature (not without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>ample reference to modern classics), and the third, which is
in the least complete state, with Modern Literature itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Longinus passage just referred to is partly a corrupt
following out of the critic’s usual and very healthy distrust
of such generalities as “<i>The</i> Sublime,” “<i>The</i> Tender,” and the
like; but it has a worse side to it. As we have already seen,
Schlegel is guilty of excess of party spirit: and I have little
doubt that, if Boileau and others of the objects of eighteenth-century-worship
had not expressed admiration for the Περὶ
 Ὕψους, he would have judged it more wisely. In fact, his
judgments, which, either in the straight way of his courses
or as <span lang="la"><i>obiter dicta</i></span>, are extremely numerous, are, though always
interesting, a curious mishmash of hit and miss, and the misses
may be too generally accounted for as the effects of that
“trying to be different” which so often besets young men of
talent. The severity with which he treats Burke<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c010'><sup>[788]</sup></a> has some
justification. But his handling of, for instance, Opitz<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c010'><sup>[789]</sup></a> is quite
out of the right tone, and has all the faults that beset the
“company of warm young men.” Some of his English judgments—for
instance, those on Milton’s verse and on Thomson<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c010'><sup>[790]</sup></a>—suggest,
besides this, an uncomfortable suspicion that his
actual knowledge of our language was not very perfect. In
Greek he fails to respond quite satisfactorily to the test of
Æschylus. And in regard to a person very different from
Milton and from Æschylus, Ariosto, it is remarkable that,
where he praises him, he is doing it to disparage Wieland,
and that in the preserved heads of an intended fuller treatment
he is most unsatisfactory. No doubt much of this mere
will-worship and “will-blasphemy” (to invent a counter-word)
would have disappeared in a final redaction for press; but
unfortunately it is there.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately there are also many better things, and on the
whole the book bears out, with evidence of a class peculiarly
cogent, the praise which has been given to Schlegel of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>freer than any German critic from a temptation to “speak
off book,” to shirk and jilt the Book itself, for expatiatory
flirtations with so-called Ideas. He is in the main faithful
to Literature, and there is no higher praise.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.54'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Illustrated still more by Friedrich.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Friedrich, though a very important person for us in general,
has a good deal less for us here, and has to a certain extent
been already touched and dealt with in the remarks
on his brother. He seems very early to have launched
out into the expanse—I shall not here by any
means say the <em>inane</em>—of general literary outline and survey;
and when he arranged his collected works not so very long
before his death,<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c010'><sup>[791]</sup></a> he showed the way in which he would
himself have wished to have them regarded by putting the
<span lang="de"><cite>Geschichte der alten und neuen Literatur</cite></span><a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c010'><sup>[792]</sup></a> first, though it was
nothing like the first written; and by arranging after it,
in the position of fillings-up or developments, the studies on
Greek<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c010'><sup>[793]</sup></a> and on Romantic<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c010'><sup>[794]</sup></a> poetry, the book on Indian Literature,<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c010'><sup>[795]</sup></a>
and the smaller critical pieces.<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c010'><sup>[796]</sup></a> Of these smaller pieces
he reproduced but few, and the actual reviews or definite
criticisms which they contain are of slight importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fact, “judging of <a id='corr401.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='books'>books”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_401.21'><ins class='correction' title='books'>books”</ins></a></span>, and even “judging of authors,”
was not Friedrich’s forte at all. The <cite>Ancient and Modern
Literature</cite> is from some points of view a book more curious
than entirely edifying. When we find Greek literature dashed
off in some sixty pages, which include a great deal of preliminary
and general matter; Roman in another sixty, which have
likewise to provide for Hebrew and Persian; five-and-thirty
doing duty for the rise of the Novel, all English <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span>
from Spenser to Milton, <em>and</em> the Spanish and French dramas,
it is surely not carping to say “this is either too little or too
much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor, when we turn to what we have called the “fillings,” do
we find much more satisfaction in some directions. Here
Greek has something like three volumes and seven or eight
hundred pages to itself—and not a volume or a page too much—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>no one can add more heartily and whole-souledly than
the present writer. But even in this ample room or verge we
find that Schlegel blenches at the book—still more at the passage
and the phrase. What he likes to talk about is matter such
as the Pelasgians; as epic (specially Homeric) and lyric poetry
in general; as this and that “school”; as “The Artistic Worth
of the Old Comedy” and “The Presentation of Female Character
in Greek”; as “The Connection and Contrast of the Interesting
and the Beautiful.” In presence of the actual literary integer
he seems like a shy person at a <span lang="fr"><i>tête-à-tête</i></span>, though he is perfectly
at home when he is addressing himself, <span lang="la"><i>ex cathedrâ</i></span>, on generals
to a large audience. People of his kind are, in their place
and at their time, most useful: the Schlegels were really
born to burst up the old narrowness, to encourage catholic
(Friedrich does not seem to me to have been quite fairly
charged with turning this into <em>Roman</em> Catholic) views: to
cheer the student on to the discovery and appropriation of
the enormous and far-flung wealth which had been so long
neglected. Their doctrines were so widely diffused in the
middle of the nineteenth century that at the end thereof they
came to be regarded as truisms and almost “falsisms.” But
their place is still honourable, though it is a place rather in the
museum of Criticism than in her living-room of study.</p>

<p class='c014'>We may conclude this chapter—since an exhaustive examination
of the German work of this period is here impossible,
and, if it were possible, would be of very little service—by
noticing one or two authors and books of different kinds,
specimen-fashion.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.55'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Uhland.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The best known in England of German lyric poets next to
Bürger and Goethe, and (in time) before Heine, Uhland, was
a man forty years younger than the author of
<cite>Lenore</cite>, and did not die till Heine himself was dead.
But his most important work<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c010'><sup>[797]</sup></a> in verse was done quite in this
period,<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c010'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and one of his most important works in connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>with, if not strictly within, our subject, the excellent Essay
on <span lang="de">“Walther von der Vogelweide,”</span> appeared as early as 1822.
Uhland’s critical dealings with northern poetic literature are
of no inconsiderable bulk,<a id='r799'></a><a href='#f799' class='c010'><sup>[799]</sup></a> and they are very important for the
history of literary taste. Not merely in time, but in character,
they stand between the earlier, most creditable and stimulating,
but often insufficiently informed, and still more often too
discursive and popular handlings, of Herder and even the
Schlegels, and the modern method of pure philology, from
which all literary appreciation is too often deliberately left
out. Uhland combines real scholarship, for his time and
means, with poetical and critical appreciation in almost the
exactly desirable blend. Would there were more such!</p>

<a id='sec8.3.56'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Schubarth.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The work of Schubarth, <span lang="de"><cite>Zur Beurtheilung Goethe’s</cite></span>,<a id='r800'></a><a href='#f800' class='c010'><sup>[800]</sup></a> may be
worth a short notice as an early and by no means contemptible
example of a kind of book which has been very
largely written during the nineteenth century, but
which we can only here take by sample. A contemporary
cannot often have been handled earlier on so great a scale: for
there are some nine hundred pages in the second edition, and
the author makes the widest possible casts round his subject.
He is not in the least satisfied with the consideration of
particular works (which he gives mainly in two batches, on
the earlier and the later respectively), or on his author’s general
literary characteristics. He has long excursus on the personages,
especially Mephistopheles. He can never refuse himself
what he modestly calls a “glance” (<span lang="de"><cite>Hinblick</cite></span>), but what is
generally a very durable and substantial stare, at things that
occur in passing,—some criticisms of A. W. Schlegel’s, the
literary contrasts of Christianity and Heathenism, Lessing and
the Education of the World, the great succession of German
philosophers from Kant to Schelling, the Historical Method,
Shakespeare, Poetry and Criticism in our day, the Nibelungen
Lied, the Devil in the Middle Ages, the Moral and the Immoral
in Art and Poetry. In short, the book is a sort of <span lang="de"><i>Quodlibeta</i></span>—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>treatise upon “Goethe and Things in General.” We have
seen many like it since: let them appear here by it their
foreman.</p>

<a id='sec8.3.57'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Solger.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Solger’s <span lang="de"><cite>Vorlesungen</cite></span><a id='r801'></a><a href='#f801' class='c010'><sup>[801]</sup></a> are an early and good example of the
defect of Æsthetic from the standpoint of this book. He often
says true things; but they are generally not the
whole or final truth, and they are almost always too
abstract. Thus, for instance: <span lang="de">“Oft verwechselt man das Interessante
mit dem Schönen.”</span><a id='r802'></a><a href='#f802' class='c010'><sup>[802]</sup></a> The truth of this is constantly
exemplified both in life and in criticism; but, laid down too
isolatedly, it blinks the question whether, in certain degree,
matter, and circumstance, the Interesting <em>is</em> not the Beautiful:
and it has an obvious and possibly dangerous connection with
the very important critical question of the “Unity of Interest.”
So, too, distinctions of Heavenly and Earthly Beauty are full
of snares: and the danger of generalisation perhaps reaches its
highest in the dictum, “In Epic and Lyric, matter is the
important thing: in the Drama, form and the pure activity
of fancy.” One might almost make out “twenty-nine distinct
damnations” involved in this, with hardly more than a thirtieth
and single way of salvation and escape!</p>

<a id='sec8.3.58'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Periodicals, Histories, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To complete the notice of this remarkable division, which
has, by authorities respectable and more than respectable,
been pronounced to be the greatest of all, and
which is certainly most important, something should
be said of the critical publications which, in Germany
as elsewhere, but almost earlier there than anywhere,
played so important a part, and of the immense industry in
literary history which came to supply perhaps the greatest
of critical needs. Of the Translations, which some would
rank with these, I shall say nothing more than that they
seem to me to have been a great misfortune for Germany—encouraging
the tendency of the nation to keep aloof from
the pure literary integer of the book-as-it-is; assimilating the
literature of other nations insensibly but unduly to German
ideals; and so making even the general judgment of authors
untrustworthy and unsound.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>The Periodicals of this time are gradually shaking off the
disguises and mannerisms which the <cite>Spectator</cite> had imposed
upon those of our last period. The most important of them,
after Lessing’s <span lang="de"><cite>Dramaturgie</cite></span>, are the <span lang="de"><cite>Frankfurter Gelehrten-Anzeigen</cite></span>
of Merck, Herder, and Goethe (1772); the <span lang="de"><cite>Teutsche

the <span lang="de"><cite>Jena Allgemeine Literatur-zeitung</cite></span> (1785); Schiller’s <span lang="de"><cite>Horen</cite></span>
(1795), and <span lang="de"><cite>Musenalmanach</cite></span>, next year; the Schlegels’ <cite>Athenæum</cite>
(1798). Of literary historians from Bouterwek to Menzel,
Schlosser,<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c010'><sup>[803]</sup></a> and others, the list is almost too long to attempt.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r679'>679</a>. Goethe would probably not himself
have refused this ascription, but might,
on the contrary, have welcomed it. He
even wanted the <span lang="de"><cite>Nibelungen</cite></span> in prose:
and more than once, I think, adopts
translateableness as a <em>criterion</em> of
Poetry (<i>v. inf.</i> note, p. <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/73128/pg73128-images.html#Page_368'>368</a>). But this
does not bridge, it only deepens, the gulf.
Again, it may be, and has been, urged
that in the <cite>Hamlet</cite> piece he was
avowedly speaking from the theatrical
point of view in every direction. True
again: but if anybody, with such
literature as <cite>Hamlet</cite> before him, can
take this point of view, we know that
his heart and his treasure lie, not in
the book, but on the boards.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r695'>695</a>. I can give one very egregious
example of this. The famous phrase,
<span lang="de">“Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh,”</span> has
been seen from a very early period to
have an allegorical, as well as a literal,
interpretation. Indeed, in the Latin
original (for the words are a translation,
as genius translates, of Lucan, ii. 273,
<span lang="la"><i>Pacem summa tenent</i></span>) the context is
perfectly unmistakable. I had myself
fallen in love with <span lang="de"><cite>Ueber allen Gipfeln</cite></span>
when I got the <span lang="de"><i>Gedichte</i></span> as a school-prize
in the year 1860, and both the
possible interpretations had struck me.
Yet a very few years ago, for giving
the <em>poetical</em> application, I was solemnly
warned by a reviewer that there was
nothing disgraceful in my not knowing
German, but that to pretend to do
so, and to give an impossible meaning
to well-known words, was quite
intolerable.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r782'>782</a>. I have already waived the controversy
between Coleridge and the
Schlegels. The fact is that the resemblance
is mainly one of <em>attitude</em>—one
of those results of “skyey influences”
which constantly manifest themselves
in different persons of genius and talent
more or less simultaneously. And it
may be added that the <em>general</em> presence
of this attitude in Coleridge before his
German visit, before either Schlegel
had attained any great notoriety, or
had written anything likely to penetrate
to England, or even anything
very characteristic, is attested not
merely by the concrete document, in
not so very alien material, of <cite>The

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV. <br> <br> THE CHANGE IN THE OTHER NATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The present chapter could hardly be omitted; but it must be
almost necessarily rather an apology for what does not appear
than a substantive presentation. Something has been said
already<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c010'><sup>[804]</sup></a> of the state of Italian and of Spanish criticism during
the eighteenth century. Its lethargy was only quickened
after (and even some time after) the beginning of the nineteenth,
by the spread of those very waves of influence which
have been described, and their origin and progress traced,
partly in the last Book, and partly in the three preceding
chapters of the present. Neither country contributed anything
original to the critical change—to the establishment of
Romanticism—though both had much to do with that establishment
as furnishing those texts of past creation which were,
as we have seen, almost the most powerful, and certainly the
most beneficent, of all agencies in the revolution. None,
perhaps, did so much by furnishing further scenery and apparatus
to the new movement: though Byron, by adopting these,
enhanced their influence in this way, yet it had been exercised
long before he wrote—before he even existed—in
England, from the time of the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>, in Germany,
from one somewhat, but not so very much, later. But all this
belongs to the far-off fringes of our subject, if even to them;
and we have only too little room for its central and substantive
portions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The critical awakening of more backward and outlying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>nations and languages, such as Russian, Polish, and Hungarian,
was in much the same case; that of the Scandinavian countries
was a little more advanced. The closer relations in which
Denmark at all times stood with Germany, and those which
Sweden maintained, not merely with Germany but with France,
must have kept them more to the front in these matters, while
the double influence was of course still more constantly, though
not quite so effectually, at work in Holland. Holberg and
Tullin and Ewald, with Baggesen a little later in Denmark,
rather accompanied than followed the reconstructive reformation
of German literature; Kellgren, Leopold, and Thorn conducted
the attack and defence in Sweden a little later still;
and the literary decadence of Dutch was at last relieved,
towards the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the
nineteenth century, by Southey’s friend, Bilderdijk. In regard
to all the languages referred to in this paragraph, though not
in regard to Italian and Spanish, I am in the disability
formerly acknowledged, as to one of them—Dutch. But I
cannot learn from any good authority that this disability is
likely here to be fatal, or even injurious. In the history of
the individual literatures their criticism is of course of great
importance: but in the history of the general subject it can
have very little.<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c010'><sup>[805]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 id='ch8' class='c002'>INTERCHAPTER VIII. <br> (WITH AN EXCURSUS ON PERIODICAL CRITICISM.)</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We here come to the point antipolar to that of the last
volume, at which<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c010'><sup>[806]</sup></a> we ventured to give a sketch of the Classic
or Neo-classic creed. The challenge to array definitions of
Classicism and Romanticism in a tabular form has already<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c010'><sup>[807]</sup></a>
been respectfully declined: but that this “declinature” comes
neither from pusillanimity, nor from complacency in purblindness,
may be best proved by undertaking the much more perilous
adventure of an anti-creed to that formerly laid down. Even
there we had to interpose the caution that absolute subscription,
on the part of all the critics concerned, ought not to be
thought of: but here the very essence and quiddity of the
situation is that no such agreement is in any way possible.
In fact, no single and tolerably homogeneous document could
possibly here be drawn up, for there would be minority (and
sometimes majority) counter-reports on every article. Even
those who resist the extremer developments take large licenses
upon the old classical position. You have your Jeffrey expressing
admiration of a <cite>Pharonnida</cite> which would have seemed to
Dennis a monstrous stumbling-block, and to Johnson mere
foolishness: while among the extremists themselves, each
man is a law unto himself. Still, it is perhaps possible to
draw up some articles of the Modern or Romantic Criticism
which was reached during this period, and we have already,
in the last two books, described at some length the process
by which they were reached. These articles will be best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>separated into two batches, the first representing the creed of
centre and extremes at once, the second that of extremes (left
or right) only: and it will be well to mark the difference from
the former statement by giving the articles separately, and not
arranging them in paragraphs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The more catholic creed is very mainly of a negative and
protesting character, and its articles might run somewhat
thus:—</p>

<p class='c027'>All periods of literature are to be studied, and all have
lessons for the critic. “Gothic ignorance” is an ignorant
absurdity.</p>

<p class='c027'>One period of literature cannot prescribe to another.
Each has its own laws; and if any general laws are to
be put above these, they must be such as will embrace
them.</p>

<p class='c027'>Rules are not to be multiplied without necessity: and
such as may be admitted must rather be extracted from
the practice of good poets and prose-writers than imposed
upon it.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Unity” is not itself uniform, but will vary according
to the kind, and sometimes within the kind, itself.</p>

<p class='c027'>The Kind itself is not to be too rigidly constituted:
and subvarieties in it may constantly arise.</p>

<p class='c027'>Literature is to be judged “by the event”: the
presence of the fig will disprove the presence of the
thistle.</p>

<p class='c027'>The object of literature is Delight; its soul is Imagination;
its body is Style.</p>

<p class='c027'>A man should like what he does like:<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c010'><sup>[808]</sup></a> and his likings
are facts in criticism for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>To which the extremer men would add these, or some of
them, or something like them:—</p>

<p class='c027'>Nothing depends upon the subject; all upon the treatment
of the subject.</p>

<p class='c027'>It is not necessary that a good poet or prose writer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>should be a good man: though it is a pity that he should
not be. And Literature is not subject to the laws of
Morality, though it is to those of Manners.<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c010'><sup>[809]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c027'>Good Sense is a good thing, but may be too much
regarded: and Nonsense is not necessarily a bad one.</p>

<p class='c027'>The appeals of the arts are interchangeable: Poetry
can do as much with sound as Music, as much with
colour as Painting, and perhaps more than either with
both.</p>

<p class='c027'>The first requisite of the critic is that he should be
capable of receiving Impressions: the second that he
should be able to express and impart them.</p>

<p class='c027'>There cannot be Monstrous Beauty: the Beauty itself
justifies and regularises.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more it has to be stipulated that these articles are not
to be regarded as definitely proposed ends and aims, which the
critical practice of the period set before itself, and by which
it worked. They are, for the most part, piece-meal results and
up-shots of a long and desultory campaign, often reached as
it were incidentally, “windfalls of the Muses,” kingdoms found
while the finder is seeking his father’s (or anybody’s) asses.
If anything general is to be detected before and beneath them,
it is a sort of general feeling of irksomeness at the restraints
of Neo-classicism—a revolt against its perpetual restrictions
and taboos.</p>

<p class='c001'>To recur once more to those egregious <span lang="la"><i>juvenilia</i></span> of Addison’s,
which, though not to be too much pressed as stigmata on his
own memory, are a useful caricature of Neo-classicism in regard
to English, some English lover of literature feels that there is
much more in Chaucer than vulgar jests, now not even fashionably
vulgar, and in Spenser than tiresome preaching. He
looks about to support his feeling with reasons, and he “finds
salvation” in the Romantic sense, more or less fully, more or
less systematically, more or less universally. The ways and
manners of the finding are very much the same in all countries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>and have been dealt with in the first Book of this volume;
the results of it, in critical form, have been set forth in that
just finished, but may deserve some summary and <span lang="la"><i>rationale</i></span>
here.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the remarkable group of English critics whom we have
called “the companions” of Coleridge, and in Coleridge himself,
the contemporary quality, and in some cases the direct suggestion,
of that great critic appear unmistakably, while in at
least most cases they are free from the chaotic or paralytic
incompleteness which he hardly ever, save in the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia</cite></span>,
shook off. They all show, as he does, though in varying
degrees, the revolt or reaction from the hidebound failure of
the baser kind of Neo-classic to <em>appreciate</em>—the effort really to
taste, to enjoy, and so to deliver that judgment which without
enjoyment is always inadequate. And it would be unjust to
regard them as merely the sports and waifs of an irresistibly
advancing tide. There <em>is</em> something of this in them,—the
worst of the something being the uncritical scorn with which
they sometimes regarded even the greatest of the departed or
departing school—the astonishing injustice of Coleridge himself
to Gibbon, and Johnson, and the Queen Anne men; of many
of them to Pope; of Hazlitt even to Dryden. But they were
not only carried, they swam,—swam strongly and steadily
and skilfully for the land that was ahead. Their appreciation
is not mere matter of fashion; it is genuine. They are honestly
appetent of the milk and honey of the newly opened land of
English literature for themselves, and generously eager to
impart of it, and of the taste for it, to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we must not—for these merits, or even for what some
may think the still greater one of providing, for almost the first
time in any literature, a great bulk of matter which is at once
valuable criticism and delightful literature itself—make a
refusal of our own critical duty as to their shortcomings, which
were neither few nor inconsiderable, and which led directly to
the sad and singular decadence of English criticism in the
middle third of the century. The first and the greatest of
these—let us fling it frankly and fairly to any partisan of the
older critical dispensation who “expects his evening prey” as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>our history draws towards its close—was, or at any rate was a
result of, the very lawlessness and rulelessness by which they
had effected their and our emancipation. True, many of the
rules that they threw off were bad and irrational, most perhaps
were inadequate, irrelevant, requiring to be applied with
all sorts of provisos and easements. But they had at any
rate kept criticism methodical, and tolerably certain in its
utterances. There had been a Creed; there had been not
the slightest difficulty in giving reasons, though they might
be doubtful ones, for a faith which, if incomplete and not
really catholic, was at any rate formally constituted. With the
new men it was different. Coleridge indeed boasted mediate
and even higher rules and principles behind his individual
judgments. But with the rest it was rather a case of sheer
private judgment, of “meeting by yourself in your own house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another drawback, dangerous always but intensified in danger
by its connection with the former, is that, while most of them
were much less intimately acquainted with the classics than
the critics of former generations had been, this deficiency was
not generally compensated by any of that extensive knowledge
of <em>modern</em> literature which the ruleless or scantily ruled
system of criticism imperatively requires. Nay, they were
all, including even Coleridge himself and De Quincey (the two
most learned, not only of these but of all English critics), very
imperfectly acquainted with <em>French</em> literature—which, as a
whole, is the best suited to qualify the study of our own,
correct it, and preserve it from flaws and corruptions. Leigh
Hunt knew little but Italian; and in Italian knew best the
things that are of least real importance for the English student.
As for Lamb, he was more than a fair Latin scholar; but he
seems to have known very little Greek, and not to have had
wide reading in the classics, either Greek or Latin, while he
betrays hardly the slightest knowledge of, or interest in, any
foreign modern literature whatever. Hazlitt’s case is worse
still, for he evidently knew very little indeed, either of the
classics or of foreign modern literature, except a few philosophic
writers, here of next to no use. In fact, one cannot help
wondering how, knowing so little, he came to judge so well—till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>the wonder nearly disappears, as we see how much better
he would have judged if he had known more. Wilson (to
look forward a little as we have done with De Quincey) had
some classics: and Lockhart had not only classics, but German
and Spanish. But one suspects the former to have known next
to nothing of modern literature: and the latter did not
use critically that which he knew. Even as regards English
itself the knowledge of all these critics was very gappy and
scrappy. They did not, with all their advantages of time,
know anything like so much of early English literature (even
putting Anglo-Saxon out of the question) as Gray had known
nearly a hundred years earlier, and Mitford in their own
early days.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, while they had deliberately, and in the main wisely,
discarded the rules which at least were supposed deductively
to govern <em>all</em> literature, they had not furnished themselves
with that comparative knowledge of <em>different</em> literatures, or
at the very least of all the different periods of one literature,
which assists literary induction, and to some extent supplies
the place of the older Rules themselves. They were therefore
driven to judge by the inner light alone; and as, fortunately,
that inner light, in at least some of them, burnt with the clearest
and brightest flame, they judged very well by it. But their
system was a dangerous one when it came to be applied, as
it inevitably had to be applied, in the majority of cases, when
their own torches went out, by the aid of smoky farthing rush-lights
in blurred horn lanterns.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, allowing for these drawbacks of commission and of
example in the most illiberally liberal manner, there will yet
remain to their credit such a sum as hardly any other group<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c010'><sup>[810]</sup></a>
in any country—as none in ours certainly—can claim. Here
at last, and here almost for the first time, appears that body
of pure critical appreciation of the actual work of literature
for which we have been waiting so long, which we have missed
so sorely in ancient times, and which, in the earlier modern,
has been given to us stinted and, what is worse, adulterated, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>arbitrary restrictions and preoccupations. In Coleridge, in
Hazlitt, in Lamb, in Leigh Hunt even, to name no others, we
have real “judging of authors,” not—or at any rate not mainly—discussion
of kinds, and attempts to lay down principles.
They are judges, not jurists, “lawmen,” not lawmongers and
potterers with codes. Appreciation and enjoyment, with their,
in this case necessary, consequences, the communication of
enjoyment and appreciation—these are the chief and principal
things with them, and these they never fail to provide.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same merits and drawbacks, differently adjusted and
conditioned, appear in the French division of the subject.
Perhaps there is nothing, even in Sainte-Beuve, of the same
consummate merit, from the point of view of appreciation, as the
best things of Hazlitt and Lamb: and I do not think there are
any critical generalities, either in Sainte-Beuve or in any other,
that quite approach the best things of Coleridge. The length
and the bitterness of the Classic-Romantic quarrel threw some
French critics into a mood of partisanship too extreme to be
quite judicial: but on the other hand it gave us that admirably
trenchant profession and confession of the faith that “nothing
depends on the subject” which we have dealt with from Victor
Hugo, and other things from other men. And, moreover, the
interest excited by this quarrel, coming to reinforce the general
French spirit of system, order, and artistic adequacy, brought
about that high general level in the new appreciative criticism
which attracted the admiration of Mr Arnold and others, and
which certainly for a time (<span lang="la"><i>cir.</i></span> 1830-1860) was much above
the level of English. Numerous as are the writers whom I
have discussed in the chapter on this subject, I feel half
ashamed of not having included more, and could easily do so.
But it is almost enough to say that, in accordance with that
gregarious or scholastic spirit which has always characterised
Frenchmen, the merits which have been so fully displayed
in Sainte-Beuve are visible more or less in almost all his
fellows.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that these merits were to some extent
(as Sainte-Beuve himself allowed with equal judgment and
generosity) transmitted or inherited from the Empire critics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>especially Chateaubriand and, in a different way and lower sense,
Villemain: while the whole secret of the method had been
revealed, or concealed, in and by the “fuliginous flashes” of
Diderot long before. But this sudden and enormous development
of it is still rather wonderful. It cannot be put down
merely to Sainte-Beuve, though Sainte-Beuve was its most eminent
representative; for, as we have seen, he did not himself
reach his perfection at once, or for a very long time, and
critical results as good as, or better than, his own <em>at the time</em>
had been produced by others earlier. It was a case of a
plenteous and great vintage, with one growth improving beyond
the rest. To this day it is impossible to read over again, well
as one may have known it, any of the better critical work of
France in this period without astonishment at its varied and
yet even excellence. But, as has just been said, it is not
always, even in its highest examples, of the <em>very</em> highest: and
perhaps at no time is what we have so often called “grasp”
a characteristic of it. It would be absurd to call it superficial:
yet, if it has a tendency towards something not of the best, that
tendency is towards superficiality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, the French, though largely influenced by foreign
nations and literatures at this period, hardly shine so much as
some others do in criticism of those literatures. But, in reference
to their own, they exemplify the new process of “judging
by the result,” and setting forth that result, with attractiveness
rivalled by hardly any, and with facility and craftsmanship
rivalled perhaps by none. From the elaborate process of
Sainte-Beuve to the impressionism of Gautier, and from the
strong meat and drink of Nisard to the froth of Janin, whatever
is provided is provided so as to give the user and consumer
the least fatigue and the most delectation. The severer
critics are not pedantic, and the lighter ones are seldom merely
frivolous or horse-playful. Occasionally, as in Nisard’s case
again, there is a solidly constructed, if not quite a solidly
based, system: occasionally, as with Planche, there are serious,
if disputable, philosophical starting-points. In Sainte-Beuve
himself there is perhaps the greatest and most orderly accumulation
of positive knowledge, never of the “marine store” kind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>that any critic has brought together. But these dignified things
never take leave of the Graces: and even the lightest armed of
the army—even Janin and those about Janin—seldom write
with the appalling absence of knowledge and of method to which
we are only too well accustomed in the critics of some other
countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>The part played by Germany in this process was, of course,
of the utmost importance, and it is by no means out of a
pusillanimous desire to disarm the indignation or the contempt
invited by some things already written that I repeat and
emphasise this acknowledgment. Germans (taking their Swiss
brethren with them) were among the very first to move the
stagnant waters. They were among the most—they <em>were</em> the
most—industrious engineers in continuing the process—in
clearing out the water-courses and turning the new streams
into them. It is impossible to exaggerate their merits in
putting at the service of criticism the massive and acute intellect
of Lessing, to substitute a new Preceptism for the old:
the wide range and towering literary faculty of Goethe, to
extend and popularise the new methods: the attractive and
contagious alacrity of the Schlegels in overrunning the provinces
and the empires of literature. But in the highest and
purest work of criticism, as we here define it, even these
their greatest are sometimes strangely wanting: and others are
wanting less strangely but more disastrously. As a rule, the
German is far <em>too</em> scientific (the epithet of praise usually selected
for him and by him) in his criticism. He has curiosity, but
not passionate or intimate enjoyment; intelligence, but not
enthusiasm; industry, but little (and hardly at all subtle)
intuition. He only gets out of the pupillary state—if he ever
does so—to get into the pedagogic. And it is difficult to say
which of these is the more unfavourable to true critical
accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may, however, be justly asked, in this place or in that,
to face that view of German criticism which Carlyle was the
first to put in England by a famous (and indeed very admirable)
“State of German Literature,”<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c010'><sup>[811]</sup></a> and which, with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>modifications, was maintained and enforced later by Mr Arnold,
who did not like Carlyle. The eulogium is well known, and it
is a magnificent one. The Germans are [1827] distinctly and
considerably in advance of other nations in Criticism. They
have “raised it to a higher power,” in fact: though he does
not, I think, use the phrase. They neither, in the old way,
discuss diction, figures, logical value, &#38;c., nor, as is usual with
the best of our own critics at present, discover and debate the
particular nature of the poet from his poetry: but, subordinating
these two, attack the essence and peculiar life of the
poetry itself. “How did Shakespeare organise his dramas?”
they ask. “What unmixed reality is bodied forth in them?” &#38;c.
Then, too, how do they proceed? Not by gorgeous mystic
phraseology<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c010'><sup>[812]</sup></a> and vague declamation? No: by “rigorous
scientific inquiry,” of which much is said, the illustration and
the enforcement at once being drawn from Schiller on “Æsthetic
Education,” and Fichte on the “Nature of the Scholar.”<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c010'><sup>[813]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This abstract is designedly cut short, not out of unfairness,
but because the original is known to many and accessible
easily to all. It is a high encomium: and even the contents
of this book will show that it is, beyond controversy, in part
at least a deserved one. From Lessing onwards there can be
no question of the intent of the Germans to bring about a
complete critical Reformation: nor can it be denied that,
after a time, and to no small extent in consequence of their
efforts, something like a complete critical Reformation was
brought about. But whether there is not an indispensable
nexus wanting somewhere—whether the general improvement
of actual criticism in Germany and elsewhere, though not
perhaps more in Germany than elsewhere, is a consequence of
the endeavour to consider the essence of Poetry and frame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>theories of it—that is the question. It would be fatuous to
say that I have shown, but I have at least endeavoured to
show, some cause against the affirmative answer. In particular,
I should like to re-invite the reader’s attention to that <span lang="la"><i>aporia</i></span>
which has been stated earlier—whether the famous criticism
of <cite>Hamlet</cite> in <span lang="de"><cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite></span> (to which Carlyle, of course,
appeals here) might not have been written without any knowledge
of the original, of its language, and of its form—in short,
on a German prose translation of Shakespeare? If anybody
is bold enough to say “Yes: and so much the better,” well
and good. But in that case his idea of the essence of poetry
and mine are so different that I must necessarily seem a
Completed Bungler to him, and that he must necessarily seem
to me (let us say) a Person to be Sincerely Commiserated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In actual “judging of authors” I have endeavoured to collect
some facts showing that the Germans did not attain to any
remarkable proficiency<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c010'><sup>[814]</sup></a> by the application of their new
systems of Æsthetic—in regard to which, by the way, no two
authorities agreed among them, and of which, as a whole, some
great authorities among them used language not much more
respectful than my own. And so, far from this “scientific”
criticism having any effect in the <em>production</em> of great poetry
or of great literature, it is a notorious fact that since Heine—who
was a hopeless rebel to the whole system—Germany has
produced no great poet, and very few great men of pure letters.
While other countries, besides producing in their unscientific
way critics at least not less great (I should of course myself
say, much greater) than Germany’s own, have maintained the
production of creative literature for the best part of a century—for
all but the whole of it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>And I have also endeavoured—if only by such hints and
glances and instances as are allowable on the plan of this
book—to show <em>why</em> the Germans seem to me to have failed,
if not exactly where they seemed to Carlyle to have succeeded,
yet in the same neighbourhood—how they have generally
either flown too high or grubbed too low, and so have failed
to gather the flowers and garner the fruit of the field of
literature. Very likely these opinions are quite unjust, but
at any rate they are not founded on ignorance; and he who
holds them is perfectly ready to fight for them at any time
with the due arms and in the proper lists.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, more shortly and in slightly altered form, I may once
more put my objection to German criticism, I can, as it
happens, do so by simply inserting a “not” in a German boast
on this very subject. Professor Schelling, of the University
of Pennsylvania, in the <cite>Alumni-Register</cite><a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c010'><sup>[815]</sup></a> of that Institution,
quotes these remarkable words from Professor Lemcke of
Marburg: “Let us for once lay aside our proverbial modesty
and openly declare that it is not the affinity of race, nor the
indications in his poetry of a German spirit, which have
brought us so close to Shakespeare, but it is that God-given
power, vouchsafed to us Germans before all other nations, by
the grace of which we are enabled to recognise true genius, of
whatever nation, better than other nations, ofttimes better than
its own, and better to enjoy and appreciate its gifts.” Far be
it from me to anticipate the obvious comments of different
kinds upon this utterance of Germanism <span lang="la"><i>in cuerpo</i></span>, and with the
encumbrances of modesty laid aside. I shall only observe that
it is precisely this “God-given power” of recognition or appreciation
which German criticism seems to me to lack. It
has the best intentions; it takes the most enormous trouble;
it accumulates the most extensive and sometimes not the least
valuable material and plant for appreciation. But, except in
the case of its very greatest exponents, it does not seem to me
often to <em>appreciate</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But—French, or German, or English, with whatever diversity
of immediate aim, exact starting-point, felicity of method, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>perfection of result—all the dominant and representative criticism
of this time tends in the direction and obeys the impulse
of some form or other of that general creed which we have
endeavoured to sketch earlier in this Interchapter, and so contributes
to the general progress (straight or circular, who shall
say?) of which this Book is the history. And when, rather,
as usual, by the influence of creative than of critical literature,
and by that of Scott and Byron above all, the same purpose
was inspired in yet other countries, the results were again the
same. The dislike of Rule; the almost instinctive falling back
upon mediæval literature as an alterative from classical and
(recent) modern; the blending of the Arts; the cultivation of
colour- and sound-variety in poetry; the variegation and
rhythmical elaboration of prose,—in all these ways, by all
these agencies, literary Criticism as well as literary practice
was reconstructed. And the end is not even yet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some more general remarks on the sub-period must be postponed
to the several parts of the Conclusion. But there is one
phenomenon which, first appearing towards the end of the
last volume, and much more noticeable in the last Book, now
becomes what the Germans call <span lang="de"><i>hervorragend</i></span>, persistently and
almost aggressively prominent. And on this we must say
something.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c010'><sup>[816]</sup></a>To enter into all the questions connected with the Periodical
here, would be obviously impossible. That it has multiplied
criticism itself is a truism; that it has necessarily multiplied
bad criticism is maintainable; the question is whether it has
actually multiplied good. I think it has. It is very difficult
to conceive of any other system under which a man like Sainte-Beuve—not
of means, and not well adapted to any profession—could
have given his life practically to the service of our Muse
as he actually did. It is difficult to imagine any other which
would have equally well suited a man like Mr Arnold, with
abundant, and fairly harassing, avocations on the one hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>and with apparently no great inclination to write elaborate
books on the other. Many officials, professional men, persons
“avocated” (in the real sense) from criticism by this or that
vocation, have been enabled by the system to give us things
sometimes precious, and probably in most times not likely to
have been given at all under the book-and-pamphlet dispensation.
Above all, perhaps, the excuse of the surplusage which
beset the regular treatise has disappeared, while the blind (or
too well-seeing) editor, with his abhorred shears, is apt to lop
excrescences off if they attempt to appear.<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c010'><sup>[817]</sup></a> Although there
certainly has been more bad criticism written in the nineteenth
century than in any previous one,—probably more than in all
previous centuries put together,—it is quite certain that no
other period can show so much that is good. And the change
which has resulted in it was needed. The early <span lang="la"><cite>Bibliothecæ</cite></span>
of the late seventeenth century wanted pliancy, variety, combination
of industrial power: the later <cite>Reviews</cite> were far too
apt to be mere booksellers’ instruments, while their wretched
pay kept many of the best hands from them, and kept those
who were driven to them in undue dependence. And further,
the increasing supply of actual literature <em>required</em> more criticism
than could easily be had under the old system of few
periodicals, eked out by independent treatises and pamphlets.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are not unimportant considerations, but they lie a little
outside of—or only touch—the question of the altered quality
and increased or decreased goodness of criticism as a whole
and in itself. And when we come to discuss this, the question
assumes rather a different aspect. The better pay, the increased
repute, the greater independence, might be thought likely to
attract, and did attract, a better class of writers to the work:
but whether this better class was always better fitted for the
particular task itself one may sometimes doubt. And there
can be no doubt at all that the same attractions must necessarily
tempt, and that the increased demand must almost force,
a very much larger supply of inferior talent to the said task.
Again, this increased demand, if not for critics, for somebody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>who would undertake to criticise (which is not quite the same
thing), coincided with a gradual removal of the not very severe
requisitions of competence which had up to this time been
imposed upon the aspirant. The Mr Bludyer of the eighteenth
century was at least supposed to know his Aristotle and his
Longinus, his Horace and his Quintilian, his Boileau and his Le
Bossu, his Dryden and his Addison. In the majority of cases
he did know them—after a fashion—though he constantly
misinterpreted the best of them and put his faith chiefly in the
worst. But the Mr Bludyer of the nineteenth has not been
supposed to know anything at all of the history and theory of
his art. Now, when you at once set up a Liberty Hall, and
dispense good things therein freely to all comers, your Liberty
Hall is too likely before long to become a Temple of Misrule.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the older arrangements went to make the critic’s trade
not merely homely and slighted, but cramped by too many,
too strict, and too little comprehended rules and formulas,
so the new tended rather to make it a paradise of the ignoramus
with a touch of impudence. It has never perhaps been quite
sufficiently comprehended, by what may be called the laity,
that though, in a sense, Blake was perfectly right in saying
that every man is a judge of art who is not connoisseured
out of his senses, yet it does not quite follow that every man,
without training and without reading, is qualified to <em>deliver
judgment</em>, from the actual bench, on so complicated and treacherous
a work of art as a book. You can take in at least great
part of the beauty of a picture at the first glance; and, no
matter what the subject may be, many of the details, with
all the colour and some of the drawing and composition, require
neither previous education nor prolonged and attentive study,
though study and attention will no doubt greatly improve
the comprehension and enjoyment of them. In the case
of a book it is very different. The most rapid and industrious
reader<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c010'><sup>[818]</sup></a> will require some minutes—it may even be some hours—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>put himself in a position to deliver any trustworthy
judgment on it at all: and he must be an exceedingly well-informed
one who is at home with every subject treated in
every volume that he has to review. You have to find out
what it is that the author has endeavoured to do, and then—the
most impossible of tasks to some critics, it would seem—to
consider whether he has done it, and not whether he
has or has not done something else which you wanted him
to do. You have to guard against prejudices innumerable,
subtle, Hydra-headed,—prejudices personal and political, prejudices
social and religious, prejudices of style and of temperament,
prejudices arising from school, university, country,
almost every conceivable predicament of man. You must be
able first to grasp, then to take off a total impression, then
to produce that impression in a form suitable to the conveyance
of it to the public. One would not perhaps be quite prepared
to assert that every one of the hundreds and thousands who
have, under the new dispensation, undertaken the office of
a critic, has been divinely endowed with these gifts before
undertaking that office, or that all of them, even if they took
the trouble to acquire what may be acquired, were likely to
succeed. There remains, of course, the comfortable doctrine
that “practice makes perfect”: or, as one of the most agreeable
and acute of modern political satirists, himself an admirable
critic, has ironically put it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That by much engine-driving at intricate junctions</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One learns to drive engines along with the best.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And if this seem small comfort to the suffering author, who
thinks that he has had too great a share of the bad criticism
and too little of the good—if it make him think of that
inspiriting substitute in the Secularist hymn for our old-fashioned
Glorias—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The social system keep in view!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Good night! dear friends, good night!”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>there are two other consolations which may suit him according
to his temperament. The one is that under any other system
his book would very probably have received no notice at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>all, which would in some cases (not in all) annoy him worse
than blame. If he be of another sort, he may perhaps anticipate
the all-healing question to any <span lang="la"><i>alma</i></span> passably <span lang="it"><i>sdegnosa</i></span>,
“Would you rather <em>not</em> have written so, and be praised?”</p>

<p class='c001'>One very necessary branch of the new criticism, as regarded
poetry, the average critic, whether in or out of periodicals, was
sadly slow to learn—indeed for the most part he recalcitrated
furiously against learning it. This was the proper appreciation
of the new effects in verbal painting and verbal music. There had
always, of course, been much of this in the great old masters:
but there had not been <em>so</em> much of it, and the critic had
been wont to treat it alternately in a peddling and in a high-sniffing
fashion.<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c010'><sup>[819]</sup></a> On the musical side especially, theory had
chiefly confined itself to the remarks on “suiting the sound
to the sense,” in a comparatively infantine fashion—putting
plenty of <em>ss</em>'s into a line about a snake or a goose, and plenty
of <em>r</em>'s into a line about a dog; giving trisyllabic feet in a line
that meant swift movement, and clogging it with consonants
when effort or tardiness came in. The new poets—Coleridge,
Keats, Tennyson,—in increasing degree, changed this simple
and rudimentary proceeding into a complicated science of
word-illumination and sound-accompaniment, which the new
critics perhaps could not see or hear, and at which they were
by turns loftily contemptuous and furiously angry. That there
was some genuine inability in the matter may appear from
looking back to Johnson’s well-known and very interesting
surprise at Pope’s fondness for his couplet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lo! where Mœotis sleeps, and hardly flows</div>
      <div class='line'>The freezing Tanais, through a waste of snows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This couplet <em>is</em> beautiful, though the <span lang="la"><i>homœoteleuton</i></span> of “Mœot<em>is</em>”
and “Tana<em>is</em>” is a slight blemish on it. But its beauty arises
from such subtle things as the contrast of the metrical rapidity
of “Tănăĭs” and the sluggish progression of its waters, and
from the extremely artful disposition and variation of the
vowel notes <em>o</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>ee</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Even this is not <em>very</em> complicated: and it occurs with Pope
and his clan once in a thousand or ten thousand lines. <cite>The
Ancient Mariner</cite> and <cite>Kubla Khan</cite> are simply compact of the
colouring symphonies of sound: and the palette becomes
always more intricate, the tone-schemes more various and
more artful, as you journey from the <cite>Eve of St Agnes</cite> to the
<cite>Palace of Art</cite>, and from the <cite>Dream of Fair Women</cite> to <cite>Rose
Mary</cite>. In the <cite>Palace</cite> especially<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c010'><sup>[820]</sup></a> the series of descriptions
of the pictures pushes both these applications of the two
sister arts towards—almost to—the limits of the possible.
Rossetti alone has since surpassed them. Take, for instance,
the cunning manipulation of the quatrain stanza<a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c010'><sup>[821]</sup></a> itself to
begin with; the figures and colour of the actual designs; and
the sound-accompaniment, to suit these figures and colours,
in such a stanza as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One seemed all dark and red: a tract of sand,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And some one pacing there alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who paced for ever in a glimmering land,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Lit with a low large moon.”<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c010'><sup>[822]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now the “values” of this are not really difficult to make
out: they can be thoroughly mastered for himself, without book
or teacher, by an intelligent boy of sixteen or seventeen, who,
having a taste for poetry, has read some—and who happens
to have been born within the nineteenth century. But they
do need intelligent, sympathetic, and to a certain extent submissive,
co-operation on the part of the person who is to
enjoy them. The adjustment of the stanza, with its successive
lines of varying capacity and cadence; the fitness of those
lines themselves to receive and express more or less detailed
images, and add, as it were, not merely stroke after stroke, but
plan after plan, to the picture; the monosyllables; the alliteration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>of the last line, and the crowning effect whereby the
picture is lightened after being displayed in shadow; the
trisyllabic foot thrown in by “glimmering,” whether you take
it in the last or the last but one of the third verse; the
atmosphere-accompaniment,—all these things might well be
almost invisible and inaudible to a critic brought up on
eighteenth-century principles. And if he saw or heard them
at all, they might affect him with that singular impatience
and disgust at refinement and exquisiteness in pleasure which
was affected by ancient philosophers, and which seems to be
really genuine in many excellent Englishmen whom the Gods
have not made in the very least philosophical. I have never
myself understood why it is godliness to gulp and sin to savour;
why, if a pleasure be harmless in itself, it becomes harmful
in being whetted, and varied, and enhanced by every possible
innocent agency. But there are doubtless some people who
think it a “poisoning of the dart too apt before to kill.” And
there are, I strongly suspect, a good many more whose senses
are too blunt to taste or feel the refinements, and who receive
the attentions of the poetic fairies with as little appreciation,
though usually with by no means as much good-humour,
as Bottom showed to those of Titania and her meyny.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is undoubtedly something of a digression, perhaps
something too much of it. But it illustrates the perils
to which the new reviewers were exposed, and at the same
time (which is the excuse for the divagation) the constant
opportunity of salvation which reviewing provides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Saws and instances.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nor need much be said of the general quality of the articles
in these famous collections. Persons of enterprise have sometimes
gone “exploring,” like Mrs Elton (on or off
their donkeys, and with or without their little
baskets), in this direction, and have come back saying, more
or less wisely, that the land is barren. Some of the more
practical of them have brought back specimens of its flora
and fauna, its soil and its rocks.<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c010'><sup>[823]</sup></a> It is perhaps more profitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>to digest some of the general considerations which have
already been stated or indicated than to dwell on particulars.
Not that these particulars are useless or always uninteresting.
It is good to know that <cite>The Monthly Review</cite>, in an article
which could not be called unfriendly, thought <cite>The Ancient
Mariner</cite> “a rhapsody of unintelligible wildness and incoherence”
[the whole thing is as clear to <em>us</em> as a proposition in
Euclid], with “poetic touches of an exquisite kind.” It is
very interesting, and not at all surprising (especially when
we remember Voltaire) to find the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, the oracle of
political Whiggery, enunciating the doctrine of Poetical Divine
Right in its article on <cite>Thalaba</cite>.<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c010'><sup>[824]</sup></a> It is interesting, again, and
almost more instructive, to find the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, in the article
which did <em>not</em> kill John Keats, finding fault with that poet
and his master Leigh Hunt, not (as might have been done
plausibly enough) for a flaccid <em>mollities</em>, for the <span lang="fr"><i>delumbe</i></span> and
the <span lang="la"><i>in labris natantia</i></span>,<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c010'><sup>[825]</sup></a> but, of all things, for “ruggedness.” If
we have pursued our critical studies aright, we know the
symptoms, we know the diseases. They are all varieties of
<em>Kainophobia</em>,—the horror and the misunderstanding of the unaccustomed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Their justification, such as it is.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But though it is not original, it is very far from superfluous
to point out that these poor old unjust judges, these Doubters
and Bloodmen of the poetic Mansoul at this crisis
of its history, were by no means without their excuses.
The original form of <cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite>
is only less inferior to the later form which most people know
now than Tennyson’s Poems<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c010'><sup>[826]</sup></a> as they appear in the editions
since 1842 are superior to themselves as they appeared to
risk the knout of Wilson and the thumbikins of Lockhart.
Southey’s unrhymed <span lang="fr"><i>vers libres</i></span> in <cite>Thalaba</cite> are, when all is
said and done, a mistake: and their arrangement is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>as unmusical as the least successful parts of Mr
Arnold’s followings of them. Exquisite as are the beauties,
intoxicating as is the atmosphere, of <cite>Endymion</cite>, no one
nowadays could pronounce it free from faults of taste of
more kinds than one, or deny that as, after all, it holds
itself out to be a story, the demand for some sort of intelligible
narrative procession is not so irrelevant as when it
is put to a lyric, in even the widest sense of that word.  And
the critics were, in every one of these cases, justified of their
victims.  Coleridge and Tennyson altered into perfection the
poems which had been so imperfect. Southey added rhyme
and better rhythm in <cite>Kehama</cite>; Keats grew from the incoherence
of <cite>Endymion</cite>, and its uncertain taste, to the perfection
of <cite>Lamia</cite> and the great <cite>Odes</cite> and the <cite>Eves</cite> of St Agnes and
St Mark. “They also serve, who only stand and—<em>whip</em>.”  But
it is better to have a soul above mere whipping.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'>Ordonnance <i>of this chapter</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It may be barely worth while to repeat the caution given
above—that “successors” in the title of this chapter is not
to be taken too literally; though, in fact, “Beware
of the <cite>Letter</cite>” would be the best possible continuous
heading for every page of every History of Literature
or of Criticism.  Construed, however, with some elasticity,
the term has more than enough truth in it.  Some of Sainte-Beuve’s
elders, most of his contemporaries, practically all his
juniors, felt the influence of the flood of criticism that welled,
gently but irresistibly, from the fountainheads of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Causeries</cite></span>
and their companion- or forerunner-volumes.  Indeed, Taine—the
most influential critic purely of the second half of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>century in France—is only Sainte-Beuve methodised and formulated.
Before him, we shall deal with three interesting
individualities belonging to each of the groups just indicated.
Then a sufficiently natural grouping will give us a notable
quartette in Renan, Taine himself, Montégut, and Scherer.
We may then diverge to another group, who represent the
influence of Sainte-Beuve very strongly blended with that of
Gautier, the most distinguished of these being Saint-Victor,
Baudelaire, and Flaubert.  Then we may take the “Naturalists”;
then two notable theorists who pushed Taine’s own
theory further, one in a less, the other in a more fruitful direction;
then a fresh batch of critics of the generally academic
or specially erudite kind.  After which we may cast back to
a kind of “Cossack” division—écheloned over the century,—and
finish with at least a salute to certain famous living
representatives of French criticism, of whom it is not, according
to our plan, lawful to speak further.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trio first referred to were more or less contemporaries,
and present various tendencies of literature and criticism in
the nineteenth century strikingly enough.  Two of them,
Jules Barbey d’Aurévilly and Victor Euphémion Philarète
Chasles, were men of letters by profession, and in constant
practice and publicity, for the greater part of the period: the
third, Ximénès Doudan, published hardly anything in his lifetime,
and was suddenly revealed, after his death and within the
last quarter of the century, as one of those observers of the
λάθε βίωσας who tend to become rarer and rarer in modern
life.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.2'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Philarète Chasles.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The eldest of the three, Philarète Chasles,<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c010'><sup>[827]</sup></a> was at an early
period of his life a refugee in England for political reasons,
and acquired there a knowledge of our literature
and institutions which stood him in good stead
for literary purposes ever afterwards.  He was, however, at
least as well acquainted with the literature of his own country,
and in the summer of 1828 he divided the Academy’s prize,
for a study of French literature in the sixteenth century, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>an Essay<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c010'><sup>[828]</sup></a> which is still worth studying, not merely as a foil
to Sainte-Beuve’s famous and epoch-making book, but in itself.
Some hold that, in one piece or another of a man’s early work,
his whole literary development is, so to say, <em>acorned</em>; there is
certainly something of the phenomenon in this tractate of
Chasles.  It has plenty of knowledge; it is well written; it
abounds in intelligent <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>; and it inclines (if with a limitation
to be stated immediately) in the Romantic direction not
obscurely, in the catholic, comparative, historical direction
beyond all question.  But there is a certain deficiency in grasp;
the style, though often brilliant and forcible in a way, too
seldom concentrates itself to light up, or to blast home, an important
proposition; and in the principles there is a certain
transaction and trimming to catch the favour of the judges.
These merits and these defects alike continued to mark Chasles'
work for the fifty years during which he unweariedly performed
it: but the defects, if they did not exactly get the upper hand,
made him more of a journalist than of a representative of literature.
He was useful and important to his contemporaries,
especially as a populariser of that English literature which was
needed as an alterative by French, at least as much as French
was by English.  But even some special interest<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c010'><sup>[829]</sup></a> cannot make
me rank him very high as a critic.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.3'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Barbey d’Aurévilly.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If Chasles gave some occasion to those who charged him with
being a “Swiss of Letters,” a journalist ready to do any journey-work—this
was certainly not the case with Barbey
d’Aurevilly, one of the most considerable eccentrics
of recent literature.  A dandy and an apostle of Dandyism,
a practitioner of the most “precious” style, a transgressor as
to forbidden subjects, and at the same time one of the most
formidable of those free lances of Catholicism of whom Ourliac,
Pontmartin, and Veuillot are the chief others in his time and
country, Barbey d’Aurévilly did a good deal to invite the title
of charlatan, which was freely bestowed on him by his numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>and recklessly provoked enemies.  But I do not think
he quite deserved it at any time: and in a very large part
of his extensive work<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c010'><sup>[830]</sup></a> he did not deserve it at all.  Nor are
many people likely to follow me in reading this without
acknowledging him as a chief example of that steady improvement
in critical power with age, which has been so often noted.
He never, indeed, became a good critic <span lang="fr"><i>sans phrase</i></span>—that is to
say, a trustworthy one.  In his country the danger-flag is
constantly flying; or, rather, there are all sorts of danger-flags,
some of which even the tolerably wary may not always recognise
as such.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.4'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>On Hugo.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Not the most difficult case is that of the attacks on Hugo,
which provoked the poet to some of his most undignified
Billingsgate in reply.  It may seem indeed odd
that a person who, though with a difference, was
himself a <span lang="fr"><i>romantique enragé</i></span>—a man who calls Villemain <span lang="fr"><i>un
eunuque littéraire opéré par le goût</i></span>—should dislike Hugo.  But,
first of all, there is the religious and political grudge against
Hugo as a deserter: and Barbey never forgets his grudges,
though he deplores the effect of other grudges on Chasles.
And, secondly, one begins to wonder whether, in the soul of his
soul, he cared much for poetry.  One of his epigrams on Hugo
himself,<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c010'><sup>[831]</sup></a> clever as it is, gives more than a hint of this.  The
poet is <span lang="fr"><i>un puits artésien de poésie—intarissable, mais de la même
eau</i></span>.  This is to a very great extent true; but who ever
quarrelled with a fountain of living water because it is a
fountain of living water, and does not, like an artificial one
on a holiday, alternately play milk, and milk-punch, and raspberry
vinegar?  Certainly no one who had ever thoroughly
realised what the Water of Poetry—the Water of Life for the
soul—is.  So, too, no one, whatever his political and religious
views, who can taste this Water of Life, could possibly dismiss
the <cite>Contemplations</cite> as <span lang="fr"><i>un livre accablant, un livre qui doit descendre
vite dans l’oubli des hommes</i></span>.  And his distaste leads
him into puerilities and almost stupidities of verbal criticism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>such as the question, when Hugo has written, <span lang="fr">“O chiens!
qu’avez vous donc dans les dents?  C’est son nom.”  “Comment
s’y est on pris pour l’y faire entrer?”</span></p>

<a id='sec9.1.5'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>On others.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But his dislike for Hugo does not, in the least, conciliate
him to, for instance, Mérimée—the same prejudices working
in a different way, and summoning others to their
aid.  This exquisite master of style and irony, this
ice-covered volcano, is at one time<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c010'><sup>[832]</sup></a> <span lang="fr"><i>un morceau de bois</i></span> (I wish
some one would show me the Broceliande where such wood
grows!), at another a “wading bird” (<span lang="fr"><i>échassier</i></span>) who occasionally
fishes up a <span lang="fr"><i>Carmen</i></span>!  (“O lead us to those ponds where
<span lang="fr"><i>Carmens</i></span> swarm!”)  A writer who is at least as different from
Mérimée as from Hugo, George Sand, is <span lang="fr"><i>le plus grand préjugé
contemporain</i></span> (another example of Barbey’s successes, at least
in epigram) <span lang="fr"><i>la grande routine dans l’admiration de ce siècle</i></span>, nay,
actually <span lang="fr"><i>commune</i></span>—which even those who have no mania for
the lady or her work may think extravagant.<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c010'><sup>[833]</sup></a>  One stares as
one reads that Southey’s <cite>Nelson</cite> is <span lang="fr"><i>bêtement raconté</i></span>, till one
remembers Barbey’s intense, flaming, roaring Byronism, or,
perhaps, till one reads the rather tell-tale statement that
“stern” [Sterne] <span lang="fr"><i>veut dire sérieux en Anglais</i></span>, which certainly
does not argue a nice acquaintance with the <span lang="fr"><i>nuances</i></span> of the
English language.  As for the other statement, that <span lang="fr">“Johnson,
l’affreux docteur Johnson, l’hippopotame de la lourde critique
Anglaise, fut un de ceux qui se moquèrent le plus de Sterne,”</span>
it is sufficient to answer, “Why, no, sir!”</p>

<a id='sec9.1.6'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Strong redeeming points in him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It may seem strange, after my citing these instances of wrong-going,
which might be very largely multiplied, that I should
have given even partial praise to Barbey d’Aurévilly as a critic.
Yet I cannot withdraw it.  In the first place, as examples
already given will have shown, he was really a great master
of the critical epigram—a thing capable of much abuse, and
of late specially abused and vulgarised and brought into discredit,
but (when well-bred, and well-trained, and well-ridden)
a great battle-horse in the critical stable for all that.  His own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>critical axioms, though generally requiring correction and completion,
are often most valuable, as when he says<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c010'><sup>[834]</sup></a> that the
two great critical qualities are Penetration and Weight. Only
he should have added (but the addition would have
hit himself hard) “Directing Judgment,” without
which diamond-point and battering-ram momentum
can but waste themselves or do mischief.  Indeed,
in his own most misguided criticisms, penetration and weight
themselves are seldom wanting.  His ninth volume, <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Critiques
ou les Juges jugés</cite></span>, is often quite admirable, almost always noteworthy,
on the most different people—on Joubert as on Villemain,
on Nisard as on Sainte-Beuve.  And almost everywhere
the writing is <em>alive</em>; the liking, if it be only crotchet, the dislike,

<a id='sec9.1.7'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Doudan.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to imagine a more curious contrast to the
often by no means ignoble hack-work of Chasles, and the
restless and somewhat “posing” activity of Barbey,
than the fireside and library arm-chair quiet which
pervades the writings of Doudan.<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c010'><sup>[835]</sup></a>  Critically, indeed, that
work is chiefly valuable as a placid and agreeable reflection
of the workings of such a life on an intellect above the average,
but of no gigantic force or “genial” individuality, and a taste
for literature which never raised itself to very active or deliberate
discharges of the critical function. His two most
regular critical exercises, the early article <span lang="fr">“De la nouvelle
école poétique”</span><a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c010'><sup>[836]</sup></a> occasioned by Sainte-Beuve’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Tableau</cite></span>, and
the later but (unless I mistake) not precisely dated <span lang="fr">“Les
Révolutions du Goût,”</span><a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c010'><sup>[837]</sup></a> are more curious than exactly important.
They exhibit, as the work of these half-recluses
often does, an odd mixture of reflection of the time-movements
and reaction against them.  His style of opposition (for he does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>oppose it) to the Romantic movement is double, and in each
case rather unexpected. <a id='sec9.1.8'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Interest of his general attitude,</i></span> One horn is pure Chauvinism.
“Who are these Germans and English, that
we Frenchmen should imitate them?” This he
shed later. But he always lifted up the other—a curious
form of belief in progress and development, which once more
almost persuades us to believe that no believer in Progress <em>can</em>
be a critic as such and for the time. In the <span lang="fr">“De la Nouvelle
École”</span> this takes the cruder form, common in the early nineteenth
century, of asking why we, with all our glorious gains,
should go back to, if not exactly barbarous ages, yet less
favoured ones? In the <span lang="fr"><cite>Révolutions</cite></span> it becomes a subtler, but
perhaps more dangerous, heresy, which draws to its aid the
fashionable fancies about time and climate and the like.
According to Doudan, it would seem, a real historical criticism
is impossible,—<span lang="fr">“Les nuances délicates s'évanouissent quand
les mœurs, etc., ont changé.”</span>  You cannot keep on the tracks
of poesy, <span lang="fr"><i>cette science émue et populaire</i></span> (note the Montaignesque
perfection of the phrase, whatever we may think of the argument),
you cannot sound <span lang="fr"><i>ces magnifiques abîmes</i></span>.  Each generation
sees only one side of the Beautiful—and apparently you
cannot extract and combine the visions of each from their
records.  Which is, I think, blasphemy against Criticism and
Literature; but some fight might, no doubt, be made for it,
and it is admirably and suggestively put.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.9'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>and particular utterances.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It would require a separate and elaborate handling to show
how far these half-progressist half-nihilist views are reflected
in the literary utterances which stud Doudan’s
<cite>Letters</cite>: but some of these must be given.  He never
achieves the supremacy of his very close analogue Joubert:
but he is certainly “to be made a note of.”  For instance,<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c010'><sup>[838]</sup></a> in a
certain <span lang="fr"><i>Chartreuse</i></span> (not otherwise identified, but which must be
Beyle’s from what follows) he says (as he should not) that it
is “stupid,” and accounts for, at the same time as he disables,
his own judgment by adding that he has not read it.  But he
knows other books of the author, who is <span lang="fr">“un mauvais sujet au
courant de tous les procédés d’imagination.”</span>  Unjust of course:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>but with how much justice and with how much more felicity
in it! In 1843 he must have somewhat modified his fifteen
years’ earlier disapproval of Old French, for in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman de
la Rose</cite></span> he sees<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c010'><sup>[839]</sup></a> “mille idées passer dans ces ombres du Moyen
Âge”—ideas, we may retort, which, if you see, you may surely
cry Halt! to, and register. Twenty years later again, in 1865,<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c010'><sup>[840]</sup></a>
he not merely condemns, in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires d’Outre Tombe</cite></span>, <span lang="fr">“le
langage torturé, comme dans M. Victor Hugo, pour produire des
effets,”</span> which might be thought to show a certain obsolescence
of judgment, but clears himself from this charge, and from his
old fault of Chauvinist criticism, not merely by defending
Eugénie de Guérin but by approving Charlotte Bronté, a combination
of literary lady-loves which is not commonplace.
He even consents, later still, to read Miss Braddon: and
expresses warm and intelligent approval of <cite>The Small House
at Allington</cite>. Only fanatical <span lang="de"><i>Goetheaner</i></span> will find much fault
with his characterisation,<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c010'><sup>[841]</sup></a> in one of his interesting letters to
A. W. Schlegel, of <span lang="de"><cite>Meister</cite></span> as “excessively desultory and chimerical”
in matter: and all but fanatical Hugonians will at least
understand his unhappiness<a id='r842'></a><a href='#f842' class='c010'><sup>[842]</sup></a> at <cite>William Shakespeare</cite>, though
the expressions of it have a touch of the comic. When you
have read the book for ten minutes you feel as if you were
standing on your head. Polyphemus must have written like
it when he had eaten a Greek and drunk a skinful of wine.
And the younger generation finds it admirable! These are the
tricks that await all of us as we grow older, unless we keep
our feet (and our heads) very carefully when we go into the
House of Literature. But Doudan is not excessively affected
by them, though, on the other hand, he does not shake himself
vigorously and critically free. He is a good specimen of the
purely contemplative and “occasional” critic—a sort of hermit
of the desert, who does not object to decide on cases that
present themselves, but who will not go to seek them.<a id='r843'></a><a href='#f843' class='c010'><sup>[843]</sup></a></p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span></div>
<a id='sec9.1.10'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Renan.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We may turn from Doudan to a very different figure, introducing
a new and important group.  It is not uncommon to
see M. Renan spoken of as a considerable critic;
on the other hand, I think some one (and no mean
authority, if my memory serves me) is reported to have said
of him, <span lang="fr">“Renan n’a pas le sens littéraire.”</span>  Both statements
are excessive: but at the risk of shocking some readers, I am
bound to say that the second is a great deal nearer the truth
than the first.  A <i>biblical</i> critic he was, no doubt: but, as has
been pointed out at the beginning of this history, the operations
of the biblical critic are always conducted on principles different
from, and usually on principles diametrically opposed to,
the principles of the criticism of literature.  Yet it may be
urged, Did he not help to produce one volume, and that on
a very interesting period, of the great <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Littéraire de la
France</cite></span>?  Did he not almost precede Mr Arnold himself in
arguing for the necessity of Criticism, and the excellent influence
not merely of Science but of Literature? and quite
precede him in exalting the literary uses and virtues of Celtic?
Has he not left us, from the <span lang="fr"><cite>Averroès</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Avenir de
la Science</cite></span> downwards, constant literary allusions and handlings,
frequent literary papers, on subjects ranging from Spinoza to
Béranger?</p>

<p class='c001'>This is all quite true: and if it were reasonable, as some
people seem to think it is, to expect that an author should use
as great length in showing why he does not deal with a subject
as in dealing with what he thinks it right to handle, I could,
as in the case of others from Voltaire downwards, produce
chapter and verse to any extent in negative justification.  But
M. Renan seemed to me, on a careful perusal of all his then
published work, twenty years ago<a id='r844'></a><a href='#f844' class='c010'><sup>[844]</sup></a> and more—he seemed to me,
on a repetition and extension of that reading a dozen years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>later<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c010'><sup>[845]</sup></a>—and he seems to me now, after recurring to his work
for the present purpose—seldom or never to have regarded
literature as literature. He said, in so many words, at the
beginning of his career, and he published the saying towards
the close,<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c010'><sup>[846]</sup></a> that literary work is <em>only</em> valuable as the work of
its time, that “the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pensées</cite></span> of Pascal and the <cite>Sermons</cite> of
Bossuet, if they appeared to-day, would be hardly worth notice.”
This exaggeration of the historic view is interesting, of course;
but it is as fatal to criticism as the absolute refusal to take
that view.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.11'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Taine.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Not thus is to be dismissed one who thought Renan a
critic and a great one. Hippolyte Taine <em>was</em> a critic, though
too often (not always) a “black horseman” of criticism.
He was a great æsthetician, he was a brilliant
literary historian—that is to say, what should be a critic on the
greatest scale. He could do splendid justice<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c010'><sup>[847]</sup></a> to another critic
of tendencies and predilections so different from his own as
those of Paul de Saint-Victor. To question his competence in
pure criticism may seem more than presumption, it may seem
pure fatuity. But, though a poet is dispensed from having a
conscience, a critic and a historian of criticism is not.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.12'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>His</i> culpa.</div>

<p class='c001'>The fault of Taine as a critic was put once for all from two
different points of view and by two widely different, though
each in his different way supremely competent,
persons, in that conversation at one of the Magny
dinners which is referred to elsewhere,<a id='r848'></a><a href='#f848' class='c010'><sup>[848]</sup></a> and the reporting
of which,<a id='r849'></a><a href='#f849' class='c010'><sup>[849]</sup></a> whether justifiable in itself or not, should bribe
Rhadamanthus in his condemnation of the Goncourtian <span lang="fr"><i>reportage</i></span>.
He did not understand the sublime—the “magnificent”—in
literature, as no less a person than Sainte-Beuve
told him on that occasion: and he did not understand it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>because, as no less a person than Gautier (consciously or unconsciously
repeating Longinus) told him, he did not see that
the secret of literature lies in the <span lang="fr">“mots rayonnants,”</span> the <span lang="fr">“mots
de lumière.”</span> Or, rather, he <em>would</em> not understand: for as two
of his selected quotations,<a id='r850'></a><a href='#f850' class='c010'><sup>[850]</sup></a> from such an apostle of the <span lang="fr"><i>mot
rayonnant</i></span> as Saint-Victor, show, he had the root of the matter
in him, but would not let it grow.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His miscellaneous critical work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Taine is, therefore, the capital example of the harm which
may be done by what is called “philosophy” in criticism. If
he had resisted this tendency, and had allowed
himself simply to receive and assimilate the facts,
he might have been one of the great critics of the
world. That he <em>could</em> have done so is shown, I think, completely
by the greatest work of his life, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Origines de la France
Contemporaine</cite></span>—in which, with a good grace, if not explicitly,
swallowing all he had said in his earlier remarks on Carlyle’s
<cite>French Revolution</cite>, he allowed himself to yield to the other
facts, and established the truth for ever, on and in an impregnable
foundation and circumvallation of document. But he
had no time to do everything: and in his literary perversity
he had gone too far. He began as quite a young man, but not
young enough to be immature, in the famous studies on La
Fontaine and Livy, by a philosophical crystallisation of the
process which Sainte-Beuve had almost invented, but had
always kept in a fluid and flexible condition—the process of
inquiring into the “circumstances,” the ancestry, country,
surroundings, religion, tastes, friends, career, of the man of
letters. As crystallised under the influence of a philosophical
determinism, this process became one of inquiring into the
racial origin, chronological period, and general environment
(<span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>) of the individual, the school, the literature, as a result
of which these “had to be”—what they seemed to M. Taine.
The man of letters, be he Shakespeare or Voltaire, Dante or
Cervantes, was simply a made-up prescription.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span></div>
<a id='sec9.1.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His</i> Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise.</div>

<p class='c001'>It might not have been so disastrous as it was, if M. Taine
had had the audacity—or from a different point of view the
pusillanimity—to choose the literature of his own
country as his sphere of principal operation.  His
theory would not have been so cramping as Nisard’s,
and he was better furnished with facilities of direct
appreciation.  That there would have been faults, gaps, oddities,
in the survey is certain: but it would have been a great and
an invaluable history of French Literature.  Now his famous
<span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise</cite></span>—one of the most brilliantly
written of its class, one of the most interesting, perhaps <em>the</em>
history of literature, which has most of literature itself—is only
valuable for qualities which are not of its own essence, and in
the qualities which are of its essence is very nearly valueless.
To any one who knows “those who are there and those who
are not”—the authors whom M. Taine discusses and the
authors whom he skips—it is a stimulating and piquant, if
not exactly an informing, book to read.  Those who do not
know them will be led hopelessly astray.  To begin with,
M. Taine himself did not know enough, though he knew creditably
much.  He had many distractions and avocations at the
time, and did not plunge on the document with anything like
the “brazen-bowelled” energy which he afterwards showed
in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Origines</cite></span>.  Whole periods—especially where language
or dialect present difficulties—are jumped with the most perfect
nonchalance, but unfortunately not always in silence.  Those
minor writers who give the key of a literature much more
surely than the greater ones (for these are akin to all the
world) receive very little attention.  The native, automatic,
irrational, sympathies and preferences, which keep a man right
much oftener than they lead him wrong, are necessarily wanting.
Nothing interferes to save the critic from the influence
of his theory.  He has constructed for himself, on that theory,
an ideal Englishman with big feet (because the soil of our
country is marshy and soft), with respect for authority (as is
shown by English boys calling their father “Governor”),
Protestant, melancholy, with several other attributes.  This
ideal Englishman is further moulded, tooled, typed, by race,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>time, <span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>: and he becomes Chaucer, Shakespeare, Pope,
Byron.  And the literature of Byron, Pope, Shakespeare,
Chaucer has to deliver itself in a concatenation accordingly.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its shortcomings.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is unnecessary to add much to what Sainte-Beuve and
Scherer,<a id='r851'></a><a href='#f851' class='c010'><sup>[851]</sup></a> both his personal friends, both practically Frenchmen,
both acquainted as few Frenchmen have been
with English literature itself, one of supreme and
the other of high critical competency, said in deprecation of
this proceeding.  But an Englishman, especially if he knows
something of other literatures as well as his own, enjoys a
<span lang="la"><i>parrhesia</i></span> which they did not enjoy.  And the only adequate
verdict that can be pronounced on Taine’s History of English
Literature is that, great as a book and as a creation, it is as
criticism not faulty, not unequal, but positively and utterly
worthless.  It does not even supply the native with useful
independent checks and views “as others see,” for the views
are the views of a theory, not a man.  It supplies the foreigner
with a false and dangerous travesty.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Instances of them.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But in reference to so famous, and in a way so engaging, a
book, it might seem impertinent not to descend a little more to
particulars.  Let anybody contrast the handlings of
Dryden and of Swift.  The former is one, I do not
hesitate to say, of the worst criticisms ever written by a great
writer, the latter one of the best.  And why?  Because Swift—great,
arch-great as he is—is very much of a piece: and
Taine can adjust him to his theory.  Dryden is not of a piece
at all, except in regard to that purely literary craftsmanship
which a foreigner can judge least well.  He is scattered,
eclectic, contradictory: and if you make any general theory
about him, or even bring any general theory in contact with
him, you get into difficulties at once.  About Keats—a great
person surely, and in casting shadows before him immense—Taine
is null; about Shelley, ludicrous; I am not sure that he
so much as mentions Browning, most of the best of whose work
was done when he wrote.  To take examples all over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>history, on <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>, on the Caroline Poets, on Gray
and Collins, he is at the mercy of any cub in criticism, and
a thing to look at and pass for the more gracious and benign
animals therein. Sometimes, as we have said above, he tempts
the horrid reflection, “Had he really <em>read</em> the authors of whom
he speaks?” And always his neglect (which may have
endeared him to Mérimée)<a id='r852'></a><a href='#f852' class='c010'><sup>[852]</sup></a> of the minor figures throws his
sketches of the major out of drawing, out of composition, out of
proportion. That he started from Sainte-Beuve is certain;
but he comes round to a point absolutely opposed to Sainte-Beuve’s
serene observatory. He speaks of what he has <em>not</em>
seen.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Montégut: his peculiarities.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It  is  strange, though perhaps not inexplicable, that the
critical renown of Émile Montégut is not greater with us than
it is.  He was one of the best and most popular
writers of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite></span> at a time
when it still held the position of the chief critical
periodical in Europe. He dealt largely with subjects of special
interest to Englishmen. Yet, with us, he has nothing like
the reputation, not merely of Sainte-Beuve, but of Scherer and
Taine. The reasons for this lie partly in the fact that Montégut
was, I believe, at all times a man who wrote for his bread,
and so not only had to do translation,<a id='r853'></a><a href='#f853' class='c010'><sup>[853]</sup></a> biography on commission,
and other hack-work, but even in his proper sphere could
not pick and choose his tasks. Another cause may probably
be found in his fondness—I will not say for prolixity, but for
handling on the very great scale. I have said elsewhere that
I believe part of the success of Sainte-Beuve to be due to
the fact that in his very best days he very rarely dealt, at
any one time, with any one subject at more than single (or
at most double) <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span> length. Montégut’s treatment of
George Eliot runs to 160 pages, that of Charlotte Bronté to
very little less, those of Musset and (more remarkably still)
of Nodier to 120 each. Now, though people will sometimes
read critical estimates of great length, they will rarely re-read
them. And they do not show the qualities of the critic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>especially to the running reader, with as much clearness, crispness,
and variety of effect as do shorter, but not too short,
pieces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet these qualities in Montégut were rare and admirable.
I do not know that I have found any work, short of the
Aristotelian-Longinian-Coleridgian level, stand the process of
re-reading, among the thousand applications of it which this
book has necessitated, better than his.  His critical appeal is
not <span lang="fr"><i>tapageur</i></span> and peremptory like that of Taine; nor has it
quite the clear, vigorous, masculine, common-sense judgment,
when prejudice does not interfere, of Scherer; but it is extraordinarily
enveloping, penetrating, intimate.  With Taine you
get soon tired, if not of his <span lang="la"><i>opes</i></span>, which are indeed considerable,
yet of his <span lang="la"><i>fumum strepitumque</i></span>: with Scherer you think that
he has said what he ought to have said, but you are not very
anxious to hear him say it again,<a id='r854'></a><a href='#f854' class='c010'><sup>[854]</sup></a> and there is rarely any
“second intention,” any suggested but not obvious thought, for
you to hear.  Montégut’s delicate, intricate reflection and
sympathy, especially at the length at which they are given,
can hardly, by the most attentive and sensitive of readers,
be taken in all at once; there are always gleanings of the
grapes, always second mowings of the grass to be made.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, Montégut was, in this group, the only one who did
not commit himself to the absolute and inseparable identification
of critical inquiry with the construction and application
of a general theory of national character and history.  He
was not, indeed, always free from this besetting delusion of
nineteenth-century criticism, a delusion which has done nearly
as much harm as all the idols of Neo-classicism put together.<a id='r855'></a><a href='#f855' class='c010'><sup>[855]</sup></a>
On the contrary, he has whole essays tending in this direction.<a id='r856'></a><a href='#f856' class='c010'><sup>[856]</sup></a>
But his best work is done in quite a different one, and, in a
late and remarkable study of Saint-René Taillandier,<a id='r857'></a><a href='#f857' class='c010'><sup>[857]</sup></a> he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>expressly draws a contrast between <span lang="fr"><i>critique littéraire</i></span> and
<span lang="fr"><i>critique qui se propose un but social</i></span>, and lays down that in
the former <span lang="fr">“les œuvres n’ont d’intérêt que par leur beauté et
leur perfection.”</span> And so, unenslaved by non-literary theory,
and only “servant,” in the good old sense of lover, to the
Muses, he is able to discern the interest of work in both
directions, while the pure national-character critics are
hampered in one by the theory they take to help them along
in the other, and not much helped by it even there.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Delicacy and range of his work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Among the best examples of Montégut’s critical genius that
I can think of is the short essay on Boccaccio<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c010'><sup>[858]</sup></a> (where he
shows conclusively that great length was not, in the
least, an indispensable condition with him), almost
all his English papers,<a id='r859'></a><a href='#f859' class='c010'><sup>[859]</sup></a> and the exceedingly agreeable
study of Théophile Gautier,<a id='r860'></a><a href='#f860' class='c010'><sup>[860]</sup></a> which remains the best thing
ever written on that author—difficult, though himself delightful.
If I were an admirer of the Guérins (I <em>am</em>, though no more
than reason, an admirer of Eugénie), I think I should prefer
his papers on these two extraordinarily overpraised young
persons to either Sainte-Beuve’s or Mr Arnold’s. The above-mentioned
piece on Saint-René Taillandier is a real triumph
of friendly advocacy. On Béranger—a subject, though for different
reasons, almost as much a touchstone as Gautier—he is
again wonderfully happy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed it is rather difficult—except when he is <em>Tainising</em>—to
discover where Montégut is not happy. To his natural
genius for delicate appreciation he united very wide reading,
not merely in French, but in English, German, and Italian.
In these foreign tongues he has the unconventional <span lang="fr"><i>main
heureuse</i></span>, which sometimes, though not very often, attends
foreigners who are not ignorant and who follow their own
judgment. The average superficial critic in England to-day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>may think that he took <cite>Guy Livingstone</cite><a id='r861'></a><a href='#f861' class='c010'><sup>[861]</sup></a> much too seriously;
the future Sainte-Beuve of England may not. He could appreciate—as,
again, not all our own critics could or can—the
unequal, and for a foreigner one might think hopelessly
baffling, qualities of Charles Kingsley. I am not sure that
this “horizontality”—this faculty of bringing himself in line
with German, Italian, English, French subjects and interpreting
them, has not done him some harm. It is something so much
out of the way, if not out of the reach, of most people that
they suspect it. But in the court of International Critical Law—which,
had it power as it has authority, would govern the
literary world—his case is pretty safe.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Scherer: peculiar</i> moral <i>character of his criticism</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It has been recognised from the first that the obituary epigram
of M. Edouard Rod on M. Edmond Scherer, <span lang="fr">“Il ne jugeait pas
les écrits avec son intelligence; il les jugeait avec
son caractère”</span>—especially if it be remembered that
<span lang="fr"><i>caractère</i></span> in French combines the meaning of the two
English words “character” and “temper”—is an
exposition, as happy as it was meant to be friendly, of the
<em>defects</em> of the subject’s criticism. But, like all epigrams, it is
scarcely adequate even to the portion of the subject to which
it applies: and this subject was by no means one-sided. Fully
to understand the dozen or so volumes<a id='r862'></a><a href='#f862' class='c010'><sup>[862]</sup></a> of trenchant and
well-informed censorship which Scherer left, it is necessary,
for all but persons of unusual powers of intellectual divination,
to know much more of the circumstances than is always
needful. He was, though French by birth, Swiss by extraction
on the father’s side, and English on the mother’s: and he was
brought up, in the straitest school of French Protestantism
and English dissent, to become a Protestant-pastor. Continental
Protestantism has always tended towards freethought, and
after many years of progressive “advance” in his opinions,
M. Scherer reached something like positive Nihilism in religion,
or at least Agnosticism of the extremest kind. He had, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>he must have read very widely in French Literature,<a id='r863'></a><a href='#f863' class='c010'><sup>[863]</sup></a> written
little or nothing on it during this period: and he did not
become a literary critic till he was forty-five. Moreover,
in the process of unsettlement of his belief, his temper, which
had always been very serious, seems to have acquired, as in
the case of Mark Pattison and others, though not all, something
like a definite roughening or souring. Further, he had paid
much attention to philosophical study, and was peremptory in
his requirement of “a philosophy” in all works of art and
letters.<a id='r864'></a><a href='#f864' class='c010'><sup>[864]</sup></a> Yet further, his relinquishment of religion had made
him only the more strenuous on the score of morality: and
against any book or writer showing loose morals, or tolerance
of them, he waged truceless war. <a id='sec9.1.20'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Its consequent limitations.</i></span> And to conclude,
while he had a somewhat limited sense<a id='r865'></a><a href='#f865' class='c010'><sup>[865]</sup></a> of the comic,
and was slow to appreciate irony, <span lang="fr"><i>litotes</i></span>, and other
things like unto them, his very intelligence, though remarkably
strong and in certain senses acute, was distinctly wanting in
flexibility, accommodation, and “play.” It was a chisel rather
than a watchspring-file, and when it encountered resistance or
stoppage of any sort, it was apt rather to try to batter and break
than to insinuate itself and so to open a way.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The solid merits accompanying them.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Add to these influences, not always tending for good, others
tending powerfully the right way—great learning, the freedom
from national prejudice derived from mixed blood,
an inflexible honesty of intention, a perfect fearlessness,
and a clear and forcible if not exactly attractive
style—and the qualities of the resultant are
easily anticipated. Such a critic will be weakest in the expression
of dislikes. On Molière, Diderot, Carlyle, Baudelaire,
especially on the three Frenchmen, M. Scherer is scarcely
even interesting or edifying. His imperfect sympathy with
the comic in the first case; his porcupine morality, perhaps
again in the first, and certainly in the second and fourth;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>his dislike of the eccentric, the abnormal, the bizarre, in
the third and fourth,—make real appreciation impossible
for him.  “What he says may be used against <em>him</em>,” to play
on the famous police caution: but in regard to his subjects
it is not so much ineffectual as almost irrelevant.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, when he speaks of writers with whom
he is more or less <em>in</em> sympathy,—on Milton, Wordsworth,
Lamartine, George Eliot,—very few critics are better worth
reading.  His temperament saves him from the usual danger
of exaggeration, except very rarely, when the indulgence is
quite pleasant; his general approval confines his exposition
of particular defects within the limits of an acute liberality;
and his setting forth of merits has all the sufficiency which
can be conferred by full knowledge, untiring industry, a strong
intelligence, and a practised and logical method.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, on the other hand, cases of attraction and repulsion
are about equally present, at least when the <span lang="fr"><i>caractère</i></span> allows
the intelligence full play, he is almost, if not quite, as good.<a id='r866'></a><a href='#f866' class='c010'><sup>[866]</sup></a>
And as these two classes of Essays are, after all, in the majority,
the criticism of M. Scherer is a most valuable exercise both
for his craftsfellows and for the general student of literature.
When his vision is not distorted by prejudice, he is the inferior
of hardly any critic in argumentative power: there is a directness,
solidity, simplicity about his methods and his conclusions
which, without being in itself better or worse than the accumulative
but not always decisive method of Sainte-Beuve and the
suggestive approaches of Montégut, forms a very useful <a id='corr449.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='alterative'>alternative</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_449.27'><ins class='correction' title='alterative'>alternative</ins></a></span>
and complement to both.  He was never popular either
in France or elsewhere: and he has hardly charm enough to
recover, or rather attain, popularity at any future time.  But
on no subject on which he has written favourably or impartially—and
not on all of those where the <span lang="fr"><i>caractère</i></span> has
had too much the upper hand—will it be safe for the real
student to neglect him.  And if that counsel of perfection
which I have more than once adumbrated here—the compilation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>of a critical <span lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span> of the best work of all times and
literatures—were ever undertaken, it would be possible to
select from his work a volume, and perhaps more than one,
of the strongest and soundest criticism to be found in the
French language.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Saint-Beuve</i> + <i>Gautier</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>These four notable writers represent, as has been said, the
principles and practice of Sainte-Beuve, more or less hardened
and methodised by an attempt to make a philosophy
of them in Taine’s case, coloured by personal and
“professional” tendencies in those of Renan and Scherer,
least altered in Montégut. But the specially Romantic tone,
which, though it never quite disappeared, had become less and
less noticeable in Sainte-Beuve himself, shows little in any
of them, unless it be in the last. On the contrary, in another
group, where Sainte-Beuve’s general influence was strongly
qualified by that of Gautier, the Romantic side, both formal
and “tonal,” appears very strongly, and leads on to a development
rather more noteworthy (except in the attacks upon
it) for creative than for critical results in the Realist-Naturalist-Impressionist-Symbolist
movement. The chief members of
this group<a id='r867'></a><a href='#f867' class='c010'><sup>[867]</sup></a> were, the famous master of <em>flamboyant</em> style Saint-Victor,
the poets Baudelaire and Banville, and the novelist
Flaubert, with whom we may join the band (among which some
of them figured with Sainte-Beuve and Gautier himself) of
contributors to the very remarkable <span lang="fr"><cite>Poètes Français</cite></span>, issued by
Crépet forty years ago. <a id='sec9.1.23'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Banville.</i></span> Banville needs but little
separate notice, for though a delightful prose-writer,
as well as a charming poet, he did not write very much criticism
besides his contributions to Crépet. But his Tractate of
Versification<a id='r868'></a><a href='#f868' class='c010'><sup>[868]</sup></a> is most important in the history of French
prosody.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Saint-Victor.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One very famous writer just mentioned, Paul de Saint-Victor,
is perhaps hardly here entitled to the place which he must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>occupy in a History of Literature, though, as a fact, all his production
came more or less under the head of criticism
in its vaguer and wider sense.  The distinction
is due partly at least to the fact that his professional criticism
was in the main either purely theatrical or else artistic,
with neither of which branches, as such, do we meddle.  But
there is more to say.  Saint-Victor published little of this;
and the chief books on which his reputation depends—the
rather famous <span lang="fr"><cite>Hommes et Dieux</cite></span><a id='r869'></a><a href='#f869' class='c010'><sup>[869]</sup></a> earlier, and <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Deux Masques</cite></span>,<a id='r870'></a><a href='#f870' class='c010'><sup>[870]</sup></a>
an elaborate study of literary drama from classical times, the
publication of which he undertook just before his death—put
forward at least some claim to be strictly of our material;
and invite attention because of the elaborate perfection of
their style.  Saint-Victor, after his death, was made the subject
of that “nimious and indiscreet” biography which has played
the ghoul to almost all men of letters, especially in France,
for many years past: and a story, already referred to, has
obtained currency that he built up his paragraphs by dotting
over the sheet nouns or epithets of striking qualities which he
wished to introduce, and then filling in the contexts to suit.
This, which is half a caricature and half an antithesis of the
Flaubertian theory and practice, is by no means incredible, and
though the practice lends itself to criticism, it is capable enough
of defence, but not as criticism itself.  The more serious point
is that Saint-Victor’s interests are obviously not in pure
literary appreciation.  He rarely attempts it, and when he
does (as in his article on Swift) the result is sometimes disastrous.
Where he succeeds he is rather historic, and historic-pictorial,
than literary.  Deriving partly from Hugo (whom he
worshipped) and partly from Gautier, he has more proportion,
less immensity in grandeur and in absurdity than the first, and
a somewhat greater sense of humanity generally than the
second, while his phrase (as in the sentence admired by Taine
and quoted above) is sometimes of enchanting beauty. He is
interesting to compare with Mr Pater: but the Englishman has
very greatly the advantage of him as a pure critic.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span></div>
<a id='sec9.1.25'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Baudelaire.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If Baudelaire had given less attention to the criticism of art<a id='r871'></a><a href='#f871' class='c010'><sup>[871]</sup></a>
and more to that of literature, and if he had been permitted
more health and longer life,<a id='r872'></a><a href='#f872' class='c010'><sup>[872]</sup></a> it is more than probable—it
is nearly certain—that he would have been
a very considerable literary critic.  As it is, there is hardly a
page of the two hundred or so which concern the subject in
the volume of his posthumously published or republished works,
entitled <span lang="fr"><cite>L’Art Romantique</cite></span>, that does not contain most remarkable
things.  He had paid beforehand for Gautier’s admirable
Preface by the most elaborate of his own individual appreciations:
and the shorter notices of Hugo and others, with the
few reviews of individual books (including <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Misérables</cite></span> and
<span lang="fr"><cite>Madame Bovary</cite></span>), make a worthy company for it.  But
Baudelaire’s special aptitude is for criticism of a slightly more
abstract kind, such as his <span lang="fr"><cite>Conseils aux Jeunes Littérateurs</cite></span>,
<span lang="fr"><cite>Les Drames et Les Romans Honnêtes</cite></span>, <i>&#38;c.</i>; while the actual
appreciations of particulars just noticed are apt to drift off
in this direction.  And it was not to be regretted: for these
<span lang="la"><i>axiomata media</i></span> are often extremely true and subtle.  If people
would only study them, the popular idea—as far as there is
any popular idea at all—of Baudelaire as a passionate and
paradoxical champion of immorality and abnormality of all
kinds would be strangely altered.<a id='r873'></a><a href='#f873' class='c010'><sup>[873]</sup></a>  Irony is indeed almost
always present: but it is yoked with a feeling for art which is
extraordinary, and with a sound good sense which, especially
in its ironic leaven, often makes one think of Thackeray.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Crépet’s</i> <span lang="fr">Les Poètes Français</span></div>

<p class='c001'>As a combined anthology of poetry and criticism, Crépet’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Poètes Français</cite></span><a id='r874'></a><a href='#f874' class='c010'><sup>[874]</sup></a> has no superior—it may be doubted whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>it has an equal.  After its general Introduction by Sainte-Beuve,
the mediæval and fifteenth-century poets
were committed to the admirably competent hands
of Louis Moland, a member of the second Romantic
generation mainly represented in this Book, who gave up the
bar to devote himself to editing and studying older French
literature; Anatole de Montaiglon, a still more learned scholar
and palæographer; Charles d’Héricault, the remarkable excellence
of whose fifteenth and early sixteenth century studies
has been referred to before, and who has hardly a critical fault
except a slight over-valuation of his pet subjects.  With the
sixteenth century—or rather with the Pléiade—recourse was
naturally had to writers who were less of specialists and more
of men of letters generally.  Gautier, Baudelaire, and Banville
are contributors; Janin’s article on Lamartine is one
of the best specimens of his more serious criticism: while
the great mass of minor poets were divided among divers
others, of whom the most fully presented and the best
known were Charles Asselineau, the bibliographer of Romanticism
and a diligent student with a pleasant pen; Hippolyte
Babou, the accredited inventor of Baudelaire’s title <span lang="fr"><cite>Fleurs
du Mal</cite></span>, and a man of remarkable though (except here)
rather wasted talent; Philoxène Boyer (<span lang="fr">“Dans les salons
de Philoxène, Nous étions quatre-vingt <em>rimeurs</em>”</span>); and
Edouard Fournier, an inestimable editor, in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Bibliothèque
Elzévirienne</cite></span> and elsewhere, and the author, among innumerable
other things, of the famous collection, <span lang="fr"><cite>L’Esprit des Autres</cite></span>
(Paris, 1855).</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole collection is a real literary and critical monument—independently
of the merit of many of the articles—because
it is practically the first attempt to deal with the
entire poetry of a literature in a catholic and impartial
manner, uninfluenced by any prevailing theory exalting or
depressing particular periods, or particular writers, at the
expense of others.  The nineteenth century had its faults, and
many of them: but this book could hardly have been written
before the nineteenth century.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.27'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Flaubert: the “Single Word.”</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If Rousseau, who wrote no criticism at all, ought, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>to some, to have a large place in a History thereof, how much
more Flaubert? For the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Madame Bovary</cite></span>,
though he wrote, or at least published, hardly any,
has filled his <cite>Letters</cite><a id='r875'></a><a href='#f875' class='c010'><sup>[875]</sup></a> with critical remarks, and is
the acknowledged godfather, though by no means the inventor
(for we have seen it as far back as La Bruyère, nay, as
Longolius, if not as far back as Virgil), of the Doctrine of
the Single Word—the notion that there is only <em>one</em> phrase,
sometimes only one single and integral combination of letters,
which will really express an author’s meaning, and that he
must wrestle with Time and the dictionary and his own invention
till he finds this. This, we say, will be found <span lang="la"><i>passim</i></span>
in Flaubert’s <cite>Letters</cite>; it will be found, by those who do
not wish to read all these (they make a mistake), admirably
and forcibly put by his disciple Maupassant in the Introduction
thereto. The doctrine,<a id='r876'></a><a href='#f876' class='c010'><sup>[876]</sup></a> though an obvious exaggeration
of the <em>true</em> doctrine of the importance of “the word,” is an
interesting one, and has been—perhaps still is—an influential,
but, on our general principles, I do not think it necessary to
give Flaubert much space here on the strength of it. He never
chose to embody his opinions on this matter in any regular
form; probably, with his very peculiar temperament, it would
have been quite impossible for him to do so, while his headlong
ways of thought and speech, so oddly contrasted with the
enormous patience of his writing, made his critical utterances
in relation to others mainly genial and Gargantuan splutters—things
<span lang="fr"><i>gigantesque</i></span>, to use his own favourite word, but not critical.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>“<i>Naturalism.</i>”</div>

<p class='c001'>As in the case of Flaubert and “Realism,” so in the case of
“Naturalism” and M. Zola, the more general considerations
will be for the Conclusion, the selection of facts
and documents, on which they are based, for this
place. To obtain these facts and documents we must a little
break the rule of not noticing persons who have lived very
recently, in the case of M. Zola himself and his friend M. de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>Goncourt. Their <span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span> must undergo the law of representation
by chiefs which presses ever and ever more upon
us. Of the host opposed to them, the chief and principal,
M. Ferdinand Brunetière, is still living.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Zola.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Rougon-Macquart</cite></span> (for out of those good
manners which do not determine by death, I shall not call
him by the periphrasis against which he specially
protested, “the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>L’Assommoir</cite></span>”) wrote a
good deal of criticism; his combative temperament supplying
the impulse, and his journalist experience the means.<a id='r877'></a><a href='#f877' class='c010'><sup>[877]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But of the nearly half-score volumes<a id='r878'></a><a href='#f878' class='c010'><sup>[878]</sup></a> in which this criticism
has been collected, perhaps only one, <span lang="fr"><cite>Le Roman Expérimental</cite></span>,<a id='r879'></a><a href='#f879' class='c010'><sup>[879]</sup></a>
is much worth re-reading; at any rate, it will give
us quite sufficient “document” here. Issued at the very
culminating-point of its author’s talent and popularity, in
1880, long after he had come through the struggles of his
youth, and long before he had fallen into that condition of
a naturalist and anti-theistic <span lang="fr"><i>voyant</i></span> which we find in <span lang="fr"><cite>Travail</cite></span>
and <span lang="fr"><cite>Vérité</cite></span>, it is thoroughly characteristic, thoroughly equipped.
There is no reason, if the author had had the same talent
for criticism that he had (after making all allowances) for
creation, why it should not display as much power in the
one direction as the nearly contemporary <span lang="fr"><cite>Attaque du Moulin</cite></span>
does in the other.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><span lang="fr">Le Roman Expérimental.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Not to mince matters (and waste time in the mincing), it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>does nothing of the sort: but, on the contrary, proves that he
had next to no critical aptitude. The contention of
the title-paper—that the exploits of M. Zola and his
friends in fiction correspond to those of Claude
Bernard in physics, supported as it is by extensive quotation
and adaptation of the famous vivisector’s own words—can, I
fear, receive no other epithet than puerile. The physiologist
can, of course, experiment very abundantly. But how, in
the name of transcendentalism and common-sense alike, can
the artist in fiction <em>experiment</em>? One artist in fiction did do
so certainly: to wit, the unlucky author of <cite>Sandford and
Merton</cite>, who trained up a little girl that she might become
his wife, with the natural result that she became somebody
else’s. <em>That</em> was a <span lang="fr"><i>roman expérimental</i></span>, on all-fours with physiological
and other experiments, if you like. Many persons
who are entertained at His Majesty’s expense, or who have
stretched His Majesty’s hemp, might also be described as
<span lang="fr"><i>romanciers expérimentaux</i></span>, and the company could be
strengthened from less sinister sources.</p>

<p class='c001'>But how can the <em>writer</em> experiment? He can observe, he
can experience, he can (the ambiguous sense of the word is
probably the source of M. Zola’s blunder) analyse, as we call
it. But he can never experiment, he can only imagine. The
check of nature and of the actual, the blow of the quintain if
you charge at it and fail, can never be his except in the metaphorical
and transformed sense of “literary” success or failure,
which brings us back to another region altogether. Now
“imagination,” “idealism,” and the like are M. Zola’s abomination,
the constant targets of his ineffectual arrows. He does
not see that he is himself using them all the time to form his
subjects, just as he is using the “rhetoric,” which he abominates
equally, to convey his expression.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Examples of his criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Consult other places to fill out M. Zola’s ideas of literature,
and they will be found all of a piece. Read<a id='r880'></a><a href='#f880' class='c010'><sup>[880]</sup></a> his  <span lang="fr">“Lettre à
La Jeunesse,”</span> with its almost frenzied cry for a
literature of <em>formula</em>, excluding genius, excluding
individuality, though only to smuggle them in again afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>by a backdoor. Read his account (very well done and
producing quite the opposite effect to that which he intends)
of the old man of letters, the man of letters <span lang="fr"><i>à la</i></span> Sainte-Beuve,
in <span lang="fr">“L’Argent dans la Littérature,”</span> and the funny details about
royalties and centimes which follow. Read him on <span lang="fr">“L’expression
personnelle”</span> in the novel—where he is specially interesting,
because with all his talent this is exactly what he himself had
not got. Read him on the famous “Human Document,” where
he misses—misses blindly and obstinately, almost ferociously,
with the ferocity of the man who <em>will</em> not see—the hopeless, the
insuperable rejoinder, “Study your documents as much as you
like, but <em>transform</em> the results of the study before you give
them as art.” Read the astonishing paralogism entitled <span lang="fr">“La
Moralité,”</span> where he excuses the product of <span lang="la"><i>tacenda</i></span> in literature
because <span lang="la"><i>tacenda</i></span> are constantly recurring in life, and even
being inserted in the newspapers which object to them in fiction.
Read his queer reversal of a truth (certainly not too
generally recognised) that Naturalism is only Romanticism
“drawn to the dregs”—<span lang="fr">“le Romantisme est la période initiale
et troublé du Naturalisme.”</span> And read above all, in another of
the papers, generally headed <span lang="fr">“De la Critique,”</span> the monumental,
fatal sentence, <span lang="fr">“Balzac, qui avait pour Walter Scott une
admiration <em>difficile à concevoir aujourd’hui</em></span>.”<a id='r881'></a><a href='#f881' class='c010'><sup>[881]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He has said it. <em>Not</em>—let it be also said and underlined with
all the emphasis possible, that M. Zola—that anybody—is to be
put out of court because he does not admire Scott. We may
be extremely sorry for him; we may think him <span lang="la"><i>quoad hoc</i></span>
utterly wrong; but he can plead the old privilege. He likes
what he can—what he does like: and there is no more to be
said. But if he cannot understand why Balzac (whom he himself
admires for certain, not for all, of his qualities) should have
admired an author whom he himself does not admire, because
his qualities are different—<em>then</em> he shows himself at once to be
destitute of the primal and necessary organ of criticism—the
organ which appreciates, which at any rate comprehends and
admits the appreciation of, things that are different. He is
even as those Neo-classics, who could not understand how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>anybody could admire what was not like Virgil, or like
something else, as the case might be. He has cut the ground
from under his own feet, thrown up his own charter and
passport. He cannot object if he be bound hand and foot and
carried into the outer darkness, where La Harpe is Minos and
M. Nisard Rhadamanthus, with the third place on the infernal
bench left vacant for the reader to fill at his pleasure.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The reasons of his critical incompetency.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The truth, I think, of it all is, that M. Zola, though in his
way a rather great man of not the best kind of letters, knew
nothing critically about literature, and did not even
take any real interest in it. I do not know that it
has been generally remarked, but I am sure that if
any one who is familiar with the enormous stretch
of the novels will exert his memory, he will find an almost unexampled
absence of literary reference, literary allusion,
literary flavour in them. Even Dickens is not to be named
in this respect beside Zola. Nay, his very critical works
themselves, though they deal with books, have nothing of the
book-atmosphere about them. When a man is really saturated
with literature, he carries the aroma of it with him like a
violet or a piece of Russian leather (less complimentary
comparisons can be added at the taste and pleasure of the
reader). He cannot dissociate himself from it if he would:
just as another cannot attain it, however hard he pretends.
When M. Zola read books it seems generally to have been
to coach up his documents and his details: indeed, why should
a person who despised poetry and rhetoric read them for
anything else? Given this ignorance or this want of appetite,
given a consuming desire to philosophise, combined with a
very weak logical faculty, an intense belief in one formula or
set of formulas, and a highly combative temperament, and
you get a set of conditions which even M. Hennequin might
admit as sufficient to turn out or account for a personage
nothing if not <em>un</em>critical.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>“<span lang="fr"><cite>Les Deux Goncourt.</cite></span>”</div>

<p class='c001'>The state of his friends, the MM. de Goncourt, was not
much more gracious; but though they were even
more influential, as holding up the general critical
doctrine and practice of naturalist-impressionism, they have left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>very little direct criticism, and what they have is of art rather
than of letters. They too seem to have read not much <span lang="fr"><i>belles
lettres</i></span>. The elder brother, towards the very end of his days
(when, by the way, he thought that Shakespeare <span lang="fr"><i>manque
d’imagination</i></span>), discovered with much interest that there had
been a man named Defoe who was a considerable Realist or
Naturalist, and that <em>M. Maspero</em> had hit upon a remarkably
interesting story about one Rhampsinitus. Their general
principle—that all literature (they, like so many moderns who
cannot write poetry, thought that prose had quite superseded
it) should consist of direct personal observation clothed in
deliberately and jealously “personal” expression—may be dealt
with later. Of individual applications of it, the most attractive
is Edmond’s quarrel with Flaubert because <em>he</em>, with all his
labour, hit only on “the epithets of all the world <span lang="la"><i>in excelsis</i></span>,”<a id='r882'></a><a href='#f882' class='c010'><sup>[882]</sup></a>
while “we” achieved the “personal” epithets. From
which it will appear that our old friend, Miss Edgeworth’s
Frederick, when he called his hat by the extremely personal
epithet of “cadwallader,” had finished the art of literature,
had sounded the depths and scaled the heights of possible
writing.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>“Scientific criticism”: Hennequin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One of the objections—and not the least forcible—to
philosophising too much, in æsthetic matters as in others, is
at the “too much” always begets a too much
more; it is like the Hybris of Greek dramatics.
Some might have thought that Nisard, with his
ideal French genius, and still more Taine, with his all-pervading
law of place and time and circumstance, would
have satisfied every normal craving for “scientific” criticism:
some even that the results of their practice were sufficient to
warn any reasonable person off such things. But to think this
would have been to ignore humanity and history. Towards the
end of the penultimate decade of the century a young and
energetic critic, M. Émile Hennequin, fluttered the dove-cotes
(or hawk’s eyries) of criticism with a still further straitening
of the method, by the promulgation of what he was pleased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>to term <em>esthopsychology</em>. His career was cut prematurely short:<a id='r883'></a><a href='#f883' class='c010'><sup>[883]</sup></a>
and, as the experienced had foreseen, “esthopsychology” soon
followed—if it did not even accompany—him to the grave.
But it made some noise for a time: and the three volumes,<a id='r884'></a><a href='#f884' class='c010'><sup>[884]</sup></a>
which he issued in three successive years, will always remain
a curiosity of criticism if not much more; while his attempt,
foredoomed as it was, is, will be, to failure, is sure to be
renewed. It was duly pointed out at the time that when
“esthopsychological” criticism proceeded most closely on its own
lines it was usually bad criticism, and that when it was good
criticism its methods were not distinguishable from those of
other kinds. This is true; but there is something more to be
said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us do M. Hennequin the justice to admit at once that
he separated his new science from strictly literary criticism,
and adjusted literature itself in an entirely peculiar and novel
attitude and garb, before he subjected it to his own processes
of pathological experiment. “Literary work,” according to
him,<a id='r885'></a><a href='#f885' class='c010'><sup>[885]</sup></a> is “a collection of written signs intended to produce
non-active emotions”: and of course in the country where,
and for the people to whom, it is this, all sorts of peculiar
phenomena may arise. In that country we can quite understand
that they regard individuality as an <span lang="la"><i>influence perturbatrice</i></span>,—a
nasty, impudent, interfering baggage that upsets
formulas, and brings your sum all wrong just when you have
got it symmetrically arranged in the ciphering book. But
those who consider individuality as the source and soul of
genius, the only begetter of poetry, the incomparable companion,
patron, voucher of great Art—what part or lot can <em>they</em> have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>with the esthopsychologists? A sort of slender snow-bridge
across the crevasse may show itself when we come to the
doctrine that, in order to understand a book, you must analyse
its effect on the reader as well as the evidences it gives of
its own originating causes and purposes in the author; but
then, as was pointed out in the antithesis above cited, there
is nothing new in this:—we are back again with Longinus,
nay, with Aristotle. And we speedily discover that the other
side of this bridge is a place to which we do not even wish
to get, though the proceedings of the inhabitants are sometimes
rather funny at a distance.</p>

<p class='c001'>An enormous tabular scheme of conditioning and distinguishing
circumstances, characteristics, means, effects, &#38;c., has
first to be arranged. The sea as a place is <i>b</i>: something more
complicated is “<i>daxxx</i>,” and so on. You compose your formula
for Hugo by the help of thus symbolising his Mystery,
his Grandiosity, and a good many other things, including the
fact (not a fact by any means) that he had in 1888 only
one disciple in England—to wit, Mr Swinburne. You study
Dickens, Heine, Tourguénieff, and Poe in this way as <span lang="fr"><cite>Écrivains
Francisés</cite></span>, others as <span lang="fr"><cite>Écrivains Français</cite></span>. And what is the
result? Dickens has much “sensibility”; Hugo is “antithetic”;
the Goncourts rather draw than write; M. Huysmans
affects sensational colour; Panurge is an incarnation of
the ancient French character. <span lang="fr">“Après avoir fait l’analyse du
vocabulaire, de la syntaxe, de la métrique, de la composition
de Flaubert, nous avons examiné ses procédés de description et
de psychologie qui se reduisent à ceux</span>—[the reader doubtless
expects something new and startling]—<span lang="fr">du réalisme”</span>! These
“secrets of Punch,” these “truths of M. de La Palisse,” simply
pullulate in M. Hennequin’s pages. We travel painfully from
Dan to Beersheba, and from Beersheba through all the wildernesses
to the uttermost parts of the sea; we accumulate the
most elaborate implements, provisions, documents of travel
that the shops can furnish or our ingenuity invent: we spend
months and years in painful prospecting. And we bring home
exactly the same conclusions which have been written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>on the walls of every house in the intellectual Israel for
Heaven knows how many years. Much μόχθος περισσὸς has
been seen in this story: some (though I should demur) would
have it to be a history—and an example—of nothing else.
But labour more utterly lost than “esthopsychology” I think
we have not found, and shall not find, even here.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>“Comparative Literature”: Texte.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>About ten years later Fate again cut short the life of
an industrious and promising critic in M. Joseph Texte. I
received, from personal friends of M. Texte,
such golden accounts of his character and abilities,
and the purpose to which he devoted his too short
life-work—that of the study of “Comparative Literature”—is
so much that to which I have devoted my own much more
extended if not quite unhampered opportunities,— that I
should like to say nothing of him but good. His last title,
<span lang="fr"><cite>La Littérature Comparée</cite></span>, sums up the drift of critical and
literary-historical thought for the last hundred and fifty years,
and especially for the last hundred. As we have seen, from
the time of Bodmer and Breitinger in Germany, from that
of Gray in England, from that of Diderot, if not even earlier,
in France, it has always been this extended and comparative
study which has corrected criticism. But it was not till the
nineteenth century was pretty far advanced that the practice
of Sainte-Beuve, and a little later the formal doctrine of Mr
Arnold, recognised and, as it were, canonised the idea; while
it is only within the last twenty or five-and-twenty years that
it has been largely carried out, and only within the last
decade or less that it has received regular academic and
other sanction. I have never myself, since I began to study
literature seriously almost forty years ago, had the slightest
doubt about its being not only the <span lang="la"><i>via prima</i></span>, but the <span lang="la"><i>via sola</i></span>
of literary safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>But literary roads are never quite “royal” in the sense of
the proverb: there are always obstacles and breaches in the
way, as well as possibilities of mistaking it. Especially, as it
seems to me, is the student of Comparative Literature exposed
to the old temptation of generalising and abstracting too much.
I think that M. Texte’s first, and perhaps best known book,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span><span lang="fr"><cite>Rousseau et les Origines du Cosmopolitanisme Littéraire</cite></span>,<a id='r886'></a><a href='#f886' class='c010'><sup>[886]</sup></a> is rather
an example of this.  It will be observed that the very title
hurries us a long way to sea—that we are almost out of sight
of the firm land of individual example-study.  If you have been
brought up solely on the drama of Racine and are introduced
to that of Shakespeare—nay, even <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>, though not to
the same extent—it is almost impossible that the contrast
should not do you good, if only by forcing you to distinguish—to
give your reasons, not to “like grossly.”  But “Literary
Cosmopolitanism”<a id='r887'></a><a href='#f887' class='c010'><sup>[887]</sup></a>? is not this a very distant and very vague
City of God? is it not even something of a Nephelococcygia?
It has never existed except to some extent during the Middle
Ages: there is no present sign of its ever being likely to exist.
And the coupling of it with Rousseau excites other apprehensions.
Rousseau was a Swiss; he lived in France, Italy,
England: his works were popular all over Europe.  There
<em>is</em> an air—but an almost obviously false air—of cosmopolitanism
about this.  When we examine the actual book we find
that, practically, it consists of a summary of the chief literary
<span lang="fr"><i>rapports</i></span> between France and England before Rousseau; of
an ingenious attempt<a id='r888'></a><a href='#f888' class='c010'><sup>[888]</sup></a> to make Rousseau himself out as a
kind of unconscious apostle of universal principles of literary
criticism: and then of some remarks on the further <span lang="fr"><i>rapports</i></span> of
English and French after him.  “Rousseau and the Relations
of English and French Literature” would be the real title of
the book: and a useful enough monograph it is.  The <span lang="fr"><cite>Études
de Littérature Européenne</cite></span> are better (the studies of Keats and
Browne are very good), and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Littérature Comparée</cite></span> interesting.
But M. Texte was always too heedless of the guile that
lurks in generals—literary more than of any other kind.  The
“Descendants of the Lakists in France” really means little
more than that Wordsworth exercised a considerable influence
on Sainte-Beuve: and “The German Influence in France” is
either a quite unmanageably large subject, or a mere disproportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>of nut and kernel.  It is very dangerous to take, as an
example of “contemporary” English literature, at the end of
the nineteenth century, <cite>Aurora Leigh</cite>, which merely represents
a brief and passing phase between the first Reform Bill and
the first Exhibition.  But nothing is further from my wishes
than to carp and cavil at M. Texte, who in an average lifetime
must have made vast and valuable progress, and who, as it
is, was a valiant pioneer in a great and effectual way.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Academic Criticism: Gaston Paris.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To pass or recur to criticism of a strictly academic character,
it is much easier to be impartial in judgment of an enemy than
of a friend.  And, but for one thing, I fear I might
be bribed in favour of M. Gaston Paris by the extraordinary
liberality and indulgence which, without
any private introduction or intercession, he showed,
some twenty years ago, towards an attempt on the subject
in which he was the unquestioned authority and master—an
attempt which did not follow his own or any other leading,
which to his expert eyes must have been full of blunders and
shortcomings, and which could have had in those eyes no
merit but that of being honest, and based on first-hand study.
Even this would not have conciliated everybody.  But M.
Paris had nothing of the dog who growls when any one approaches
<em>his</em> bone, and it was most interesting to watch in
<em>Romania</em>, the periodical which he helped to direct for more
than thirty years, the difference of his method and that of
some of his coadjutors.  One could only marvel at his perfect
freedom from this <span lang="fr"><i>lues</i></span> of the mere scholar.</p>

<p class='c001'>This equity or urbanity, however, though the most pleasing
to persons who experienced it, was not the only nor perhaps
the chief, it was certainly not the most purely literary, excellence
of M. Paris as a critic.  He had another, still rarer in
the philologist—the faculty of appreciating literature.  His
philological and other conscientiousness, indeed, prevented him
from reprinting—during long years in which all students of
Old French coveted it—the delightful <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Poétique de
Charlemagne</cite></span>, with which (in 1865-66) he began his literary
career: and most of his time was spent on lectures, editions,
and miscellaneous work in the periodical just mentioned and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>others.  But many of his <span lang="fr"><cite>Romania</cite></span> Essays (which we may
hope will be collected) display the rare union just mentioned, as
the work of few other philologists in the older modern tongues
has done throughout Europe, though the late Professor Kölbing
came an honourable second in Germany.  And in 1885 he
actually collected, under the title of <span lang="fr"><cite>Poésie du Moyen Age</cite></span>, some
of his more popular lectures on the title-subject, on the origins
of French Literature, on <span lang="fr">“La Chanson de Roland et La
Nationalité Française”</span> (a fine piece, delivered <span lang="fr"><i>crânement</i></span>, as his
students might have said, in beleaguered Paris, during the
central December of the Année Terrible), on the quaint semi-comic
epic of Charlemagne’s Pilgrimage, on the story of
Parnell’s <cite>Hermit</cite>, on his father.  Some years later he gave an
excellent but too brief <cite>Manual of Mediæval French Literature</cite>:
and in 1896 he published a very noteworthy collection of
articles, obituary and other, on modern men of letters, entitled
<span lang="fr"><cite>Penseurs et Poètes</cite></span>.  The longest and most remarkable of these
is on the poet, M. Sully Prudhomme—a lifelong friend—and
it shows better than anything else M. Paris’s power of pure
literary criticism in subjects far distant in character as in time
from those in which his hand usually dealt.  I do not agree
with him here; I cannot rank his subject’s estimable and
faultless, but rather cold and limited, poetic gift so highly as
he did.  But for careful investigation and grouping of results,
for delicate arrangement of merits so that they may produce
the best effect, for good taste in enthusiasm, and ingenuity,
never unfair, in advocacy, the article will stand comparison with
one of Sainte-Beuve’s at his most interested and good-natured,
or one of Montégut’s at his least discursive and protracted.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Caro</i>, <span lang="fr"><cite>Taillandier</cite></span>, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>The number of learned or academic critics—some older,
some younger—who might be grouped round or arranged after
M. Paris is of course very large: but I do not know
any who combined his special accomplishment with
his general literary quality.  Long ago, in another place, I was
guilty of introducing two of the class as “M. Saint-René
Taillandier, a dull man of industry, and M. Caro, a man of
industry who is not dull.”  Neither, alas! “is” anything now:
but a renewed and special study of their work for the purposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>of this book does not induce me to tone down the flippancy.
Still, it is fair to say that neither seems to have intended what
we call here “pure literary criticism.” Caro<a id='r889'></a><a href='#f889' class='c010'><sup>[889]</sup></a> was (and was
satirised rather unjustly as such, in a comedy famous in its
day) a sort of ladies’ philosopher, a moralist in kid gloves and
dress clothes. Taillandier (the “Saint-René” appears to be
one of the usual self-embellishments) was in the same way a
historian and political student, who, in his capacity as regular
contributor to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Deux Mondes</cite></span>, attempted a great deal of
literary work, and collected a good deal of it.<a id='r890'></a><a href='#f890' class='c010'><sup>[890]</sup></a> He had little
grasp or suppleness: and retained a great deal of the old
academic horror of the bizarre. A review by him of Flaubert’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Éducation Sentimentale</cite></span> was, I think, the particular <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> which
convinced me of his dulness: and I have never read anything
which removed the impression.<a id='r891'></a><a href='#f891' class='c010'><sup>[891]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.1.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The “Light Horsemen”: Janin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of what may be called the light horsemen of French criticism,
almost any one, with even the slightest knowledge of the
subject, would at once name Jules Janin as the
hetman. He was very early singled out by Nisard
in his attack on la <span lang="fr"><i>littérature facile</i></span>;<a id='r892'></a><a href='#f892' class='c010'><sup>[892]</sup></a> and though he
replied with all the wit, style, and facility itself for which he
was justly renowned, he probably—or rather certainly—knew
as well as anybody else that it was easier to counter-raid the
enemy’s country than to defend his own. A “prince of criticism,”
as he was called (and is said to have liked to call himself,
with the mixture of self-deceit and self-satire which all
men of some brains know), he hardly was: a prince of journalism
he was most certainly. Of his purely literary exercises
in the art practically nothing survives; his early romantic
extravagances in novel kind, <span lang="fr"><cite>L’Âne Mort</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Barnave</cite></span>, have
outlasted them, while themselves possessing no very solid
fame. His purely theatrical criticisms are said to be of some
value as <span lang="fr"><i>points de repère</i></span>. But, on the whole, if the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>brilliant of journalists, he was also the most of a journalist
among brilliant men of letters. His appreciations were written
with all that appetising <span lang="fr"><i>à peu près</i></span>—that dash and sparkle and
apparent mastery—which, more than any solid qualities, have
given French criticism its reputation with those who do not
know. But they represent little real knowledge on the writer’s
own part: and while destitute of any theory of criticism of the
more abstract kind (which they might lack and be no worse
for it), they display no standard of personal taste, no test of
goodness drawn from comparative experience, to supply the
place of such a theory. They had their day; but they have
ceased to be.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.39'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Pontmartin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It might have been scarcely safe to class M. Armand de
Pontmartin with the light horse during his lifetime; he would
at any rate, in all probability, have taken care to
show that light horsemen not only do not belong
to the non-combatant divisions of an army, but are one of its
most formidable arms of offence and defence. The extreme
voluminousness (he reprinted some fifty or sixty volumes of
his <span lang="fr"><cite>Samedis</cite></span> and other work) of this Royalist critic; the sharpness
of his tongue, especially in a book entitled <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Jeudis de
Madame Charbonneau</cite></span>, which fluttered literary critics in the
middle years of the Second Empire; and the fact that Sainte-Beuve
took the field against him on more than one occasion,
have created, I believe, rather an unfavourable impression.
This is not quite fair. M. de Pontmartin wrote, or at least
republished, too much; he was too generally under the influence
of splenetic partisanship in more than one kind, and there was
in his criticism a certain superficiality and tendency to gossip
round a subject, whether in attack or in caress, rather than to
grasp and penetrate it. But he had great acuteness, wrote an
admirable French style of the older and purer kind, and certainly
had no reason to be ashamed of the way in which he
harassed the “Naturalists” in his later years of contribution
to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Gazette de France</cite></span>. The other publications of these
years<a id='r893'></a><a href='#f893' class='c010'><sup>[893]</sup></a> show a mellowing of temper and no loss of ability:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>while even in the earlier <span lang="fr"><cite>Samedis</cite></span> a great number of true
things, well put, may be found.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.40'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Veuillot.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But the most formidable of French critical Pandours—a man
of genius in his own way, and the inspirer in that way of no
small or inconspicuous divisions of journalism in
other countries and since his own time—was Louis
Veuillot. Most of his “swashbuckler” writing—to do him
justice he did not merely swash the buckler, but had a right
swashing blow with the sword at his enemy’s face and body—was
directed to religious and political matters. But he had
a real interest in literature: and though his principles, as
Extreme Right and Extreme Left principles generally do,
allowed and indeed encouraged him to regard no blow
as foul in their service, he is perhaps less unscrupulous in
administering literary sensations<a id='r894'></a><a href='#f894' class='c010'><sup>[894]</sup></a> than in dealing out others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The twelve solid volumes of his <span lang="fr"><cite>Mélanges</cite></span>,<a id='r895'></a><a href='#f895' class='c010'><sup>[895]</sup></a> despite the apparently
ephemeral character of many of their subjects, are
still excellent reading, especially for the judicious student
who knows how to skip, and does not disdain to do so now
and then. Even when Veuillot raises false issues he is seldom
quite negligible; and when he is in sympathy with his subject
he is sometimes extraordinarily happy; while one seldom or
never detects in him the note of personal spite, or the mere
pedantic snarling, which, as has been said, are the unpardonable
sins of criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might surprise some people who have heard of Veuillot
only as a tomahawk-and-black-flag critic to read the affectionate
and admirably executed eulogy of Edouard Ourliac, at
iv. 580 of the second series; until Sainte-Beuve went out
of his way to offend the Clericals, Veuillot appreciated him;
and even in regard to Hugo, his handling (at ii. 542 of the
second series) is astonishingly clever. Further, Veuillot is
very seldom silly: one of the few instances I can think of,
is his attack on Sainte-Beuve and Rabelais. It is never
quite easy to understand what there is in Master Francis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>which upsets and disorganises even the most intelligent Roman
Catholic critics, and the fact is one of the heaviest charges
against the Roman form of Catholicism, from the literary point
of view. Of poetry, Veuillot had not much sense; one would
hardly expect it in him, and it is certain that his doctrine,
that a great poet must sing <span lang="fr"><i>ni sa dame, ni la dame d’autrui,
ni les dames de tout le monde</i></span>, would, if it were carried out
universally, make poetry extremely uninteresting. He could
be vulgar, as in his attack on Edmond About (at v. 372 of
the second series), but then it has to be remembered that
About could be and was extremely vulgar himself, and that
the greatest danger of this sort of rough-and-tumble journalism
is that you are too apt to accept the weapons and the
methods of the adversary.</p>

<a id='sec9.1.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Not so black as, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We have little space for “Mr Bludyer” in this book, and
therefore it is that I have given some to his greatest and
most gifted representative in the flesh during our
time. One may think indeed—I do—that Mr
Bludyer is a very unnecessary evil,—that it is perfectly possible
to fight as keenly and as stanchly as you like with the pen,
and yet never write otherwise than fairly, honestly, and like
a gentleman. But whether Mr Bludyer must come or not,
he generally does; and when he does, it would be well if he
always had the wits, and the raciness, and, on the whole,
the freedom from mere dirty selfish vanities and jealousies and

<a id='sec9.1.42'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The present.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is half pleasant and half unpleasant to conclude this notice
of French criticism with only a reference to those distinguished
living representatives of it who hold up its banner
and spread its sails to all the winds of the
spirit. To name no juniors, I have already had more than
one occasion to refer to the great erudition, the remarkable
acuteness, and the practised critical method of M. Ferdinand
Brunetière. These qualities, with an agreeable and sufficient
difference, appear also in M. Émile Faguet: while M. Anatole
France illustrates a more strictly impressionist, and a lighter
kind of our office with one of the most charming styles that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>any living European writer uses for the pleasure of the human
race; and there are many who greatly admire the wit, the
alertness, and the truly Gallic nonchalance of M. Jules

<span lang="fr"><cite>Pensées</cite></span> (Paris, 1880)  is definitely literary
in subject; but the  book is a
small one, and its contents seem to
me to lack something of the absolute
spontaneity and <em>privacy</em> of the larger
and earlier collection. There are,
however, noteworthy things; let me
mention, as one of several for honour,
the important dictum, p. 24, that <span lang="fr">“une
forte mémoire <em>ne dénature pas</em> assez ce
qu’on imite,”</span> where Doudan trembles
on the verge of that truth which so
few have reached, that art is <em>dis</em>realisation.
Not so good is the wish that
Scott had attempted Wellington or
Napoleon as a hero, for it shows that
Doudan was unwilling to accept (what
nevertheless, as the context shows, he
half saw) the cardinal law of the Historical
Novel, that the main personages
must <em>not</em> be historical.</p>

hasty.  It seems that his mother,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r877'>877</a>. Two such different persons and
writers as Zola himself and M. Anatole
France have, in different parts of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires des Goncourt</cite></span>, given true and
valuable testimony to one of the great
merits of that much-abused and certainly
much-<em>abusable</em> thing journalism—the
facility and audacity, namely, which it
confers. No doubt the facility which
it gives may turn to slovenliness,
and the boldness in attempting great
tasks to levity: but this need not be
so,—M. France himself is a convincing
evidence in the one case at least. And
there is no doubt that the practised
habit of undertaking complicated things
at short notice, and of doing the
“day’s darg” in the day, protects a
man from that “impossibility of getting
ready,” that “not knowing how
to begin” (and still less how to finish),
which has sterilised even genius so
frequently.</p>

joke, it is not very good: taken seriously,
it is fatal. It may not be easy

you love: that attitude is gone, without
hope of recovery, as soon as you
hate.</p>

that “Comparative <em>Literature</em>” is a
very awkward phrase, neither really
representing <span lang="fr">“Littérature <em>Comparée</em>”</span>

<p class='c007'>There are few things <a id='err471.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='errata' title='so'>more</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#e_471.1'><ins class='correction' title='so'>more</ins></a></span> difficult to the conscientious writer,
and few which he knows will receive so little consideration
from the irresponsible reader, as those overlappings on the
one hand, and throwings-back on the other, which are incumbent
on all literary historians save those who are content to
abjure form and method altogether. The constituents of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>present chapter give a case in point. Some of them may
seem unreasonably torn away from their natural companions
in our last chapter dealing with English criticism; some
unreasonably kept back from the society of the next. But,
once more, things have not been done entirely at the hazard
of the orange-peel or the die.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The English Critics of 1830-60.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There is, to the present writer at any rate, a distinct colour,
or set of colours, appertaining to most of the English criticism
of 1830-1860, and it seems worth while to bring
this out by isolating its practitioners to a certain
extent. We shall find these falling under three
main divisions—the first containing the latest-writing, and
in some cases hardly the least, of the great band of periodical
critics, mostly Romantic in tendency, of whom Coleridge is
the Generalissimo and Hazlitt the rather mutinous Chief of
the Staff. Then come the mighty pair of Carlyle and Macaulay;
and then a rear-guard of more or less interesting minors
and transition persons. So, first of the first, let us deal with
one who, not only to his special partisans and friends, seemed
a very prince of critics in his day.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.2'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Wilson.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The difficulties of appraising “Christopher North” as a critic
are, or should be, well known in general; but it is doubtful
whether many persons have recently cared to put
themselves in a position to appreciate them directly.
No such revival has come to him as that which has
come to Hazlitt: and I have elsewhere given at some length<a id='r896'></a><a href='#f896' class='c010'><sup>[896]</sup></a>
the reasons which make me inclined to fear that no such
revival is very likely to come soon. For Wilson accumulated,
with a defiance valorous enough but certainly not discreet,
provocation after provocation to Nemesis and Oblivion. He
is immensely diffuse; he is not more diffuse than he is desultory;
and in the greater part of his work he sets his criticism
with a habitual strain of extravagant and ephemeral <span lang="it"><i>bravura</i></span>
which even the most tolerant and catholic may not seldom
find uncongenial. <a id='sec9.2.3'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Strange medley of his criticism.</i></span> But all this, though bad, is followed by
things worse—critical incivility of the worst kind, violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>political and other partisanship, a prevailing capriciousness
which makes his critical utterances almost valueless,
except as words to the wise; and occasional accesses
of detraction and vituperation which suggest
either the exasperation or some physical ailment, or
a slight touch of mental aberration. And yet, side by side
with all this, there is an enthusiastic love of literature; a very
wide knowledge of it; a real capacity for judging, wherever
this capacity is allowed to exercise itself; a generosity (as in
the famous palinodes to Leigh Hunt and to Macaulay) which
only makes one regret the more keenly that this generosity
is so Epimethean; and, lastly, a faculty of phrase which,
irregular and uncertain as it is, apt as it is to fall on one
side into bombast and on the other into bathos, is almost
always extraordinary. An anthology of critical passages might
be extracted from Wilson which few critics could hope to
surpass; but the first and probably the last exclamation of
any one who was driven by this to the contexts would be,
“How on earth could such good taste live in company with
a Siamese brother so hopelessly bad!”<a id='r897'></a><a href='#f897' class='c010'><sup>[897]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.2.4'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The</i> Homer <i>and the other larger critical collections</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Wilson’s admirers, from his daughter downwards, have
lamented that the <cite>Homer</cite>—a good thing but not his best—was
the only one of his longer and more connected
critical exercitations that was included<a id='r898'></a><a href='#f898' class='c010'><sup>[898]</sup></a> in his
collected works, while three others—the <cite>Spenser</cite>,
the <cite>Specimens of British Critics</cite>, and the dialogue
<cite>Dies Boreales</cite>—were excluded. The reasons of the exclusion
seem obvious enough. At a rough and unprofessional “cast-off,”
I should guess each of the two earlier series at about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>300 of these present pages, and the <cite>Dies</cite> at nearer 400. This
would have meant at least another three volumes added
to a collection already consisting of twelve. The Devil’s
Advocate, moreover, would have had other things to urge.
Whatever Wilson had gained by age and sobering (and he
had gained much), he had lost nothing of his tendency to
exuberance and expatiation. After the first paper or two,
the whole of the <cite>Spenser</cite> criticism is occupied with an examination
of the First Book of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite> only—the
best known part of the poem. The <cite>Specimens of British
Critics</cite>—an admirable title which might have served for a
most novel, useful, and interesting work—means in fact a
very copious examination of Dryden’s critical utterances and
a rather copious one of those of Pope—so that this <em>professor</em>
at any rate has not filled this <span lang="la"><i>hiatus</i></span>. And the <cite>Dies</cite>, though
they have got rid of some of the superabundant animal spirits
of the <cite>Noctes</cite>, are (it is necessary to say it) very much duller.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Spenser.</div>

<p class='c001'>Yet the regretters had some reason. I myself could relinquish
without much sorrow, from the matter actually republished,
more than as much as would accommodate
the <cite>Spenser</cite>, nearly as much as would make room
for the <cite>Specimens</cite> also. As for the former, the famous compliment
of Hallam<a id='r899'></a><a href='#f899' class='c010'><sup>[899]</sup></a> (not a person likely, either on his good
or his bad side, to be too lenient to Wilson’s faults) is at least
a strong prerogative vote. Nor does it<a id='r900'></a><a href='#f900' class='c010'><sup>[900]</sup></a> stand in need of this
backing. Wilson spends far too much time in slaying forgotten
Satans that never were very Satanic—the silliness of
the excellent Hughes, the pedantry of the no less excellent
Spence, the half-heartedness, even, of Tom Warton. He does
not entirely discard his old horse-play and his old grudges,
though we can well pardon him for the fling that “the late
Mr Hazlitt” did not think Sidney and Raleigh gentlemen.
But he discards them to a very great extent; as well as the
old namby-pambiness which sometimes mars his earlier work,
when he is sentimental, and which, with him as with Landor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>was a real danger. And the thing is full of admirable things,—the
generous admission that “Campbell’s criticism is as
fine and true as his poetry”; the victorious defence of the
Spenserian stanza against those who think it a mere following
of the Italians: a hundred pieces of good exposition and appreciation.
While as for mere writing, we have “written fine”
after De Quincey and Wilson himself for some eighty years.
But have we often beaten this: “Thus here are many elegies
in one; but that one [<cite>Daphnaida</cite>] is as much a whole as the
<em>sad</em> sky with all its <em>misty</em> stars”?<a id='r901'></a><a href='#f901' class='c010'><sup>[901]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.2.6'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Specimens of British Critics.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Specimens of British Critics</cite>,<a id='r902'></a><a href='#f902' class='c010'><sup>[902]</sup></a> ten years later, maintains,
and even with rare exceptions improves, the standard of taste
in the <cite>Spenser</cite>, but its faults of disproportion, irrelevance,
and divagation are much greater. The
author himself once insinuates that his work may be
taken for “an irregular history of British Criticism,”
and it certainly might have been made such—“nor so very
irregular neither,” as they would have said in the days when
Englishmen were allowed to write English, and grammarians
to prate about grammar. But Wilson cannot resist his propensity
to course any hare that starts. As has been said
above, he has the compass of a by no means meagre volume
for dealing ostensibly with no British critics but Dryden and
Pope. If he dealt with them only, and only as critics, there
would not be much fault to find, though we might wish for
a better and fuller planned work. But not a quarter—not,
we might almost venture to say, a tenth—of his space is
occupied with them or with criticism. A very large part is
given to discussion, not merely of Dryden and Pope but of
Churchill as <em>satirists</em>; Dryden’s plays, rhymed and other,
receive large consideration, his theory of translation almost
a larger, with independent digressions on every poet whom he
translates. Two or three whole papers are devoted to Chaucer,
not merely as Dryden translated him but in all his works, in
his versification, and so forth. I do not wonder that, seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>a farrago so utterly non-correspondent to its title, any one
should have hesitated to reprint it. But I do know that there
is admirable criticism scattered all over it, that if it appeared
as <cite>Miscellanies in English Criticism</cite>, or <cite>Critical Quodlibeta</cite>, or
something of that sort, it would be worth the while of every
one who takes an interest in the subject to read it: and I do
think it a pity that it should be practically as if it were not.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Dies Boreales.</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps hardly as much can be said of <span lang="la"><cite>Dies Boreales</cite></span>,<a id='r903'></a><a href='#f903' class='c010'><sup>[903]</sup></a> which
was written when the author’s bodily strength was breaking,
and which betrays a relapse on senescent methods,
with, naturally, no relief of juvenile treatment. The
dialogue form is resumed, but “Seward,” “Buller,” and “Tallboys”
are, as Dryden might have said, “the coolest and most
insignificant” fellows, the worst possible substitutes for
“Tickler,” and the Shepherd, and the wonderful <em>eidolon</em> of
De Quincey in the <cite>Noctes</cite>. There is no gusto in the descriptions,
even of Loch Awe: and among the rare and melancholy
flashes of the old genial tomfoolery, the representation
of a banquet at which these thin things, these walking
gentlemen, sit down with the ghost of Christopher to a
banquet of <em>twenty-five</em> weighed pounds of food per man, is
but ghastly and resurrectionist Rabelaisianism. But if there
is not the old exuberance, there is the old pleonasm. Wilson
seems unable to settle down to what is his real subject—critical
discussion of certain plays of Shakespeare and of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.
Nor, when the discussions come, are they quite of the first class,
though there are good things in them. The theory of a “double
time” in Shakespeare—one literal and chronological, which is
often very short, and another extended by poetical licence—is
ingenious, if somewhat fantastic, and, critically, quite unnecessary.
But the main faults of the writer, uncompensated for the
most part by his merits, are eminently here.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Faults in all,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>These faults, to be particularised immediately, result in a
lack of directness, method, clean and clear critical grip, which
is continuous and pervading. Forty pages could
generally be squeezed into fourteen, and not seldom
into four, with great gain of critical, no loss of literary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>merit. Now diffuseness, a bad fault everywhere, is an absolutely
fatal one in critical literature that wishes to live. It is
hard enough for it to gain the ear of posterity anyhow; it is
simply impossible when the real gist of the matter is whelmed
in oceans of divagation, of skirmishes, courteous or rough-and-tumble,
with other critics, of fantastic flourish and fooling. It
is no blasphemy to the <cite>Poetics</cite> and the Περὶ  Ὕψους themselves
to say that to their terseness they owe at least half
their immortality.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and in the republished work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the earlier, better known, and more easily accessible work
the same merits and defects appear in brighter or darker colours,
as the case may be. In once more going through
the ten volumes of the <cite>Noctes</cite>,<a id='r904'></a><a href='#f904' class='c010'><sup>[904]</sup></a> and the <cite>Recreations</cite>,
and the <cite>Essays</cite>, I can find nothing more representative
than the Wordsworth Essay,<a id='r905'></a><a href='#f905' class='c010'><sup>[905]</sup></a> the famous onslaught on
Tennyson’s early Poems,<a id='r906'></a><a href='#f906' class='c010'><sup>[906]</sup></a> and the eulogy of Macaulay’s <cite>Lays</cite>,<a id='r907'></a><a href='#f907' class='c010'><sup>[907]</sup></a>
though I should now add <cite>An Hour’s Talk about Poetry</cite> from
the <cite>Recreations</cite>.<a id='r908'></a><a href='#f908' class='c010'><sup>[908]</sup></a> In the first the author tries to be systematic,
and fails; in the second he is jovially scornful, not without
some acute and generous appreciation; in the third he is
enthusiastically appreciative, but not, on the whole, critically
satisfactory; in the fourth he compasses English sea and land
to find one Great Poem, and finds it only in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.
Everywhere he is alive and full of life; in most places he is
suggestive and stimulating at intervals; nowhere is he critically
to be depended upon. Praise and blame; mud and
incense; vision and blindness alike lack that interconnection,
that “central tiebeam,” which Carlyle, in one of the least
unsympathetic and most clear-sighted of his criticisms of his
contemporaries, denied him. The leaves are not merely—are
not indeed at all—Sibylline; for it is impossible to work them
into, or to believe that they were ever inspired by, a continuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>and integral thought or judgment. There is enjoyment on
the reader’s part, as on the writer’s, but it is “casual fruition”:
there is even reasoning, but it is mostly on detached and
literally eccentric issues. A genial chaos: but first of all,
and, I fear, last of all, chaotic.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>De Quincey: his anomalies</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Wilson’s neighbour, friend, contributor, and, in a kindly
fashion, half-butt, De Quincey<a id='r909'></a><a href='#f909' class='c010'><sup>[909]</sup></a> is, like Southey, though in
different measure, condition, and degree, rather
puzzling as a critic. He, too, had enormous reading,
a keen interest in literature, and a distinctly critical
temperament. Moreover, during great part of his long life,
he never had any motive for writing on subjects that did not
please him: and, even when such a motive existed, he seems to
have paid sublimely little attention to it. The critical “places”
in his works are in fact very numerous; they meet the reader
almost <span lang="la"><i>passim</i></span>, and often seem to promise substantive and important
contributions to criticism. Nor, as a matter of fact,
are they ever quite negligible or often unimportant. They
constantly have that stimulating and attractive property
which is so valuable, and which seems so often to have been
acquired by “the Companions” from contact with the loadstone-rock
of Coleridge. Every now and then, as in the well-known
“Note on the Knocking at the Gate in <cite>Macbeth</cite>,” De Quincey
will display evidence (whether original or suggested) of almost
dæmonic subtlety. Very often, indeed, he will display evidence,
if not of dæmonic yet of impish and almost fiendish acuteness,
as in his grim and (for a fellow artificial-Paradise seeker)
rather callous suggestion<a id='r910'></a><a href='#f910' class='c010'><sup>[910]</sup></a> that Coleridge and Lamb should
have put down their loss of cheerfulness in later years not
to opium or to gin but to the later years themselves. “Ah,
dear Lamb,” says the little monster,<a id='r911'></a><a href='#f911' class='c010'><sup>[911]</sup></a> “but note that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>drunkard was fifty-six years old and the songster twenty-three!”</p>

<a id='sec9.2.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and perversities as a critic,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet De Quincey is scarcely—on the whole, and as a whole—to
be ranked among the greatest critics. To begin with, his
unconquerable habit of “rigmarole” is constantly
leading him astray: and the taste for jaunty personality
which he had most unluckily imbibed from
Wilson leads him astray still further, and still more gravely
and damagingly. In the volume on <cite>The Lake Poets</cite> I do not
suppose that there are twenty pages of pure criticism, putting
all orts and scraps together. The main really critical part
of the essay on Lamb—then a fresh and most tempting subject—is
a criticism of—--Hazlitt! The extremely interesting
subject of “Milton <i>v.</i> Southey and Landor” (though the paper
does contain good things, and, in particular, some excellent
remarks on Metre) is all frittered and whittled off into
shavings of quip, and crank, and gibe, and personality. The
same is the case with what should have been, and in part is,
one of his best critical things, the article on Schlosser’s
<cite>Literary History of the Eighteenth Century</cite>. The present writer
will not be suspected, by friend or foe, of insisting ruthlessly
on a too grave and chaste critical manner: but De Quincey
here is too much for anything and anybody. “For Heaven’s
sake, my good man,” one may say almost in his own words,
“do leave off fooling and come to business.” In the very long
essay on Bentley he has little or no criticism at all; and here,
as well as in the “Cicero,” he is too much stung and tormented
by his hatred of the drab style of Conyers Middleton to see
anything else when he gets near to that curious person, as he
must in both. On Keats, without any reason for hostility, he
has almost the full inadequacy of his generation, with not much
less on Shelley; and when he comes to talk even of Wordsworth’s
<em>poetry</em>, though there was no one living whom he
honoured more, he is not very much less unsatisfactory.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>in regard to all literatures.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nor are these inadequacies and perversities limited to
English. There was a good excuse (more than at one time
people used to think under the influence of the fervent Goethe-worship
of the mid-nineteenth century) for his famous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>furious attack on <span lang="de"><cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite></span>; but what are we to think
of a man (admitting that much has been said
and thought of it) coolly “dismisses,”<a id='r912'></a><a href='#f912' class='c010'><sup>[912]</sup></a> without so
much as an unfavourable opinion, the lyric and
miscellaneous poetry of one of the greatest lyric poets of
Europe, or the world? He persistently belittles French
literature: and he had, of course, a right to give his judgment.
But, unfortunately, he not only does not give evidence of
knowledge to support his condemnation, but does give negative
evidence of ignorance. That ignorance, as far as contemporary
literature went, seems to have been almost absolute. Even
Chateaubriand (a rhetorician after his own heart) he never
names in his dealing with French rhetoric, and never at all,
so far as I remember, except as a praiser of Milton; while the
subject before the seventeenth century seems to have been
equally a blank to him. But he is most wayward and most
uncritical about the classics. He gives himself all the airs
of a profound scholar, and seems really to have been a very
fair one. Yet that “Appraisal of Greek Literature” which
Professor Masson has ruthlessly resuscitated<a id='r913'></a><a href='#f913' class='c010'><sup>[913]</sup></a> might almost
have been written by the most ignorant of the “Moderns,” two
hundred years ago, for its omissions and commissions. He
seems to have been in his most Puckish frame of mind if he
was not serious; if he was, <span lang="la"><i>actum est</i></span> (or almost so) with him
as a critic.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their causes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The truth seems to be that he had no very deep, wide, or
fervent love of poetry as such. He could appreciate single
lines and phrases,—Milton’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sole sitting by the shores of old romance,”</div>

      <div class='line'>“Beyond the arrows, views, and shouts of men”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>but on the whole his curious, and of course strictly “interested,”
heresy about prose-poetry made him as lukewarm
towards poetry pure and simple as it made him
unjust to the plainer prose, such as that of
Middleton, that of Swift, and even (incomprehensible as this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>particular injustice may seem) that of Plato. Yet we should
not be sorry for this heresy, because it gave us, independently
of the great creative passages of the <cite>Confessions</cite>, the <cite>Suspiria</cite>,
and the rest, the critical pieces of the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and the
<cite>Style</cite>. It is somewhat curious that in the midst of an appreciative
period we should have to fall back upon “preceptist”
work. But it is certainly here that De Quincey, though not
without his insuperable faults, becomes of most consequence
in the History of Criticism. In fact, he may be said to have
been almost the “instaurator”<a id='r914'></a><a href='#f914' class='c010'><sup>[914]</sup></a> of this preceptist criticism
which, since its older arguments had become nearly useless
from the disuse of the Neo-classic appreciation upon which they
were based, or which was based upon them, very urgently and
particularly required such instauration.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Rhetoric <i>and the</i> Style.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Rhetoric</cite> in particular, with all its defects, has not been
superseded as a preceptist canvas, which the capable teacher
can broider and patch into a competent treatise of
the ornater English style. Its author’s unconquerable
waywardness appears in his attempt—based
in  the most rickety fashion and constantly self-contradictory—to
combine the traditional and the popular
senses of the word in a definition of Rhetoric as <em>unconvinced</em>
fine writing,—the deliberate elaboration of mere <span lang="fr"><i>tours de force</i></span>
in contradistinction to genuine and heartfelt Eloquence. But
its view is admirably wide—the widest up to its time that can
be found anywhere, I think; it is instinct with a crotchety
but individual life; and if the defects of the new method
appear when we compare it with Rapin or Batteux, the merits
thereof appear likewise, and in ample measure. Nor, despite
some digression, is there much of the author’s too frequent
tomfoolery.  His erudition, his interest in the subject, and
(towards the end) his genuine and alarmed eagerness to contradict
Whately’s damaging pronouncements as to poetry and
prose, keep him out of this. The <cite>Style</cite> is much more questionable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>and has much more ephemeral matter in it—the author
rides out all his favourite cock-horses by turns, and will often
not bate us a single furlong of the journey to Banbury Cross
on them. Moreover, much of it is occupied with often just
condemnation of the special vices of ordinary English newspaper-and-book
style in the earlier middle nineteenth century—Satans
which, though not quite extinct, have given main
place to other inhabitants of Pandemonium. But the paper,
with the subsidiary pieces on <cite>Language</cite> and <cite>Conversation</cite>, will
never lose interest and importance.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His compensations.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>No incident in the ruthless duty of the critical historian has
given me more trouble, or been carried through with more
reluctance, than this handling of De Quincey. I
have to acknowledge a great, a very early, and a
constantly continued indebtedness to him. I could, as was
hinted at the beginning of this notice, compile a long and
brilliant list of separate instances in which his old-man-of-the-sea
caprices have left him free to give admirable critical
pronouncements. His suggestive and <em>protreptic</em><a id='r915'></a><a href='#f915' class='c010'><sup>[915]</sup></a> quality cannot
be overrated. On a philosophical point of criticism he is very
rarely wrong, though even here he is too apt to labour the
point, as in his deductions in the <cite>Appraisal</cite> from the true and
important caution that “sublime” is a defective and delusive
word for the subject of Longinus. But he is of those critics,
too commonly to be found in the present stage of our inquiry,
who are eminently <em>unsafe</em>—who require to be constantly surrounded
with keepers and guards. I do not remember that Mr
Matthew Arnold often, or ever, refers to De Quincey. But I
cannot help thinking that, in his strictures on the English critics
of his earlier time, he must often have had him in mind. He
could not have charged him with narrow reading. He could
not have charged him with mere insularity, or with flattery of
his co-insulars. But he might easily have produced him,—and
it would have been very difficult to get him out of the Arnoldian
clutches, as a victim of that “eternal enemy of Art, Caprice.”</p>

<a id='sec9.2.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Lockhart.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There are few critics of whom we have been less allowed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>form a definite and well-grounded opinion, than of one of the
most famous of the practitioners of the art in the
first half of the nineteenth century. Some, I should
hope, of the very unjust obloquy which used to rest on Lockhart
for his “scorpion” quality has been removed by Mr Lang’s
<cite>Life</cite>: but of his more than thirty years of criticism not much
more is accessible than what was public the day after his
death. It is true that this—the main articles of it being
the <cite>Scott</cite>, the <cite>Burns</cite>, the <cite>Theodore Hook</cite>, and the earlier <cite>Peter’s
Letters</cite><a id='r916'></a><a href='#f916' class='c010'><sup>[916]</sup></a>—is a very goodly literary baggage indeed, and one
which any man of letters might consent to have produced, at
the cost of a large curtailment of his <span lang="fr"><i>peau de chagrin</i></span>.
<a id='sec9.2.17'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Difficulty of appraising his criticism.</i></span> It
is true, further, that great part of it puts Lockhart
in the forefront of the critical army. But its
criticism, like the mousquetaireship of Aramis, is
but of an interim order; and of the necessarily great body of
anonymous reviewing, wherein at once the sting and the strength
of his critical powers must have been revealed, we have but
a very few instances even indirectly authenticated, the chief
being the famous <cite>Quarterly</cite> review of Tennyson’s early work.
Eking this further with indications from letters and the like,
we shall find in Lockhart a notable though a more accomplished
instance of the class of critic to which, on the other side,
Jeffrey also belonged. He is differentiated from Jeffrey by
a harder, if clearer and stronger, intellect, by more critical
system, and, no doubt, by less amiability of temper. He had
formed his taste by a deeper and wider education, he possessed
a better style, and he had, as his non-critical work shows,
far more imagination.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Tennyson <i>review</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the “Tennyson” paper, the authorship of which appears
to be certain, we have an example of Lockhart himself and of
the school of criticism which he represents, very far
from at the best, but far also from at the worst.
This worst would have been nearly reached by him, if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>could believe the earlier “Keats” article in <cite>Blackwood</cite> to be
his—a charge which, fortunately, is as yet Not Proven to any
competent court, though there may be searchings of heart about
it. Undoubtedly Lockhart was capable of indulging in that
style of sneering insolence which, though it is intellectually at
a higher level by far than the other style of hectoring abuse,
is nearly as offensive, and less excusable because it requires and
denotes this very intellectual superiority. But the author of
the Tennyson article displays neither. He is merely polite and
even good-tempered for the most part; and it is constantly
necessary to remember, that if there were beauties which ought
to have drawn his eyes away from the faults, there were, in
the earlier versions of these early poems, faults enough to
draw the eyes of any critic of his stamp away from the beauties.
There were trivial and mawkish things which have disappeared
entirely; flawed things which have been reforged into perfect
ring and temper; things, in the main precious, which were
marred by easily removable disfigurements. From unwillingness
to accept the later stages of a movement of which he
had joyfully shared the earlier, Lockhart cannot be cleared;
but his guilt extends little further.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Coleridge, Burns, Scott, and Hook.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And he has excellent compurgation to bring forward against
it. Quite early, in <cite>Peter’s Letters</cite>, he had defended the genius
of Coleridge against his detractors with admirable
vigour and taste. He is extraordinarily good on
Burns. The abundant critical remarks which he has
interspersed in the <cite>Life of Scott</cite> itself, afford a wonderful
exhibition of sensitiveness and fineness of taste, with
nothing to be set on the other side except the very pardonable
tendency to undervalue and grudge a little in the case of the
non-Scottish novels. But an almost better instance of Lockhart’s
critical power, on the biographical as well as the literary
side, is to be found in his article on Theodore Hook, with its
remarkable welcome of the new school of Victorian novelists,
which shows that his want of receptivity, as regards new
poetry, did not extend to prose fiction.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His general critical character.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, we have few better examples than Lockhart,
if we have any, of the severer type of critic—of the newer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>school, but with a certain tendency towards the older—a little
too prone, when his sympathies were not specially
enlisted, to think that his subjects would be “nane
the waur of a hanging”—a little too quick to ban,
and too slow to bless—but acute, scholarly, logical, wide enough
in range, when his special prejudices did not interfere, and
entitled to some extent to throw the responsibility of those prejudices
on the political and literary circumstances of his time.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hartley Coleridge.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If the pixies had not doomed Hartley Coleridge<a id='r917'></a><a href='#f917' class='c010'><sup>[917]</sup></a> to a career
(or an absence of one) so strange and in a manner so sad, there
would pretty certainly have been a case, not merely of
poetic son succeeding poetic father, against the alleged
impossibility or at least non-occurrence of which succession
he himself mildly protested, but of critical faculty likewise
descending in almost the highest intensity from father to son.
And the not ungracious creatures might plead that, after all,
opportunity was not lacking. During that strange latter half
of his lifetime when he fulfilled, more literally than happily,
the poetic prophecy of Wordsworth in his childhood, he
seems to have had very little other occupation—indoors at
least—besides criticism actual and practical. But, with the
inveterate Coleridgean habit of “marginalling,” and the equally
inveterate one of never turning the Marginalia to any solid
account, the results of this practice, save in the case of the
famous copy of Anderson’s <cite>Poets</cite> (shabbiest and slovenliest
treasure-house of treasures immortal and priceless!) which
bears his father’s and uncle’s notes as well as his own, are
mostly Sibylline Leaves <em>after</em> the passage of the blast. <a id='sec9.2.22'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Forlorn condition of his criticism.</i></span> When
a man commits his critical thoughts to the narrow
margins of weekly newspapers <em>unbound</em>—indeed, if
he had them bound, the binder would no doubt have
exterminated them after the fashion of his ruthless race—he
might just as well write on water, and better on sand. Still,
the <span lang="la"><i>disjecta membra</i></span> do exist—in the <cite>Biographia Borealis</cite>, or
<cite>Northern Worthies</cite>, to some extent; in the Essays, collected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>the pious, if sometimes a little patronising, care of his brother
Derwent, to a much greater; and perhaps in one instance only,
the “Massinger and Ford” Introduction, after a fashion in a
manner finished. Yet even here the intended critical <span lang="la"><i>coda</i></span> is
wanting, and the inevitable critical divagation too much
present.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its quality.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But in all this there is also present, after a fashion of which
I can remember no other instance, the evidences of a critical
genius which not only did not give itself, but which
absolutely refused itself, a chance. Hartley Coleridge
has never, I think, been the subject of much study: but a
more tempting matter for “problem” lovers can hardly exist.
Nothing in his <em>known</em> history accounts for the refusal. He
was admittedly not temperate: but no one has ever pretended
that he was the slave of drink to the extent to which his
father was the slave of opium; his interest in literature was
intense and undying—that every page that he ever wrote
shows beyond possibility of doubt; and the fineness of his
critical perceptions is equally indubitable. <a id='sec9.2.24'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Defects</i></span> But the extraordinary
and, I think, unparalleled intellectual indolence—or
rather intellectual paralysis—which beset him,
seems to have prevented him not merely from writing,
but from that mere reading in which men, too indolent to
make any great use of it, constantly indulge as a mere pleasure
and pastime. He confesses frankly that he had read very little
indeed: and this, though he had been almost all his life within
reach of, and for great part of it actually under the same roof
with, Southey’s hardly equalled library. This ignorance leads
him wrong not only on matters of fact, but also on matters of
opinion: indeed, he seldom goes wrong, except when he does
not know enough about the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is unfortunate that we have hardly anything finished
from him in the critical way, except the “Massinger and
Ford” and the Essays he wrote for <cite>Blackwood</cite>, while these
last bear such a strong impress of Wilson’s own manner<a id='r918'></a><a href='#f918' class='c010'><sup>[918]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>that it is impossible not to think them Christopherically
sophisticated. In the <cite>Northern Worthies</cite> he professes not to
meddle with Criticism at all, or to touch it very little. In the
“Marvell,” however, the “Bentley,” the “Ascham,” the
“Mason,” the “Roscoe,” and the “Congreve,” he is better than
his word, and gives some excellent criticism as a seasoning to
the biography. <a id='sec9.2.25'></a><span class='sni side5'><i>and examples.</i></span> One cannot, indeed, but grudge the time that
he spends on such worthless stuff as <cite>Elfrida</cite> and
<cite>Caractacus</cite>, but we must remember that in that
generation of transition, the generation of Milman and Talfourd
earlier, of Henry Taylor and others later, the possibility of
reviving the serious drama was a very important subject
indeed. Hartley, whose reverence for his father is as pleasant
as his affection for his mother, evidently thought much of
<cite>Remorse</cite> and <cite>Zapolya</cite>, and might probably, if he ever could
have got his will to face any hedge, have tried such things
himself. On Congreve he is nearly at his best: and his essay
certainly ought to be included in that unique volume of
<span lang="la"><i>variorum</i></span> critical documents on the Restoration Drama, which
somebody some day may have the sense to edit.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he would be neither Hartley nor Coleridge if he were
not best in the <cite>Marginalia</cite>, good as the “Massinger and Ford”
introduction is in parts. The “Anderson” notes, and those on
Shakespeare, deserve the most careful reading: and I shall be
much surprised if any competent reader fails to see that the
man who wrote them at least had it in him to have made no
inadequate thirdsman to his father<a id='r919'></a><a href='#f919' class='c010'><sup>[919]</sup></a> and Hazlitt.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Maginn.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Very few people nowadays, in all probability, think much
of “bright, broken Maginn”<a id='r920'></a><a href='#f920' class='c010'><sup>[920]</sup></a> as a critic; and of those few
some perhaps associate his criticism chiefly with
such examples of it as the article on Grantley
Berkeley, which almost excused the retaliation on its unfortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>publisher, or the vain attempt to “bluff” out the Keats
matter by ridiculing <cite>Adonais</cite>.  Even as to most of his exercitations
in this most unlovely department, or rather corruption,
of our art, there is perhaps something to be said for him.  He
fights, as a rule, not with Lockhart’s dagger of ice-brook
temper, nor with Wilson’s smashing bludgeon, but with a kind
of horse-whip, stinging indeed enough, but letting out no
life and breaking no bones at worst and heaviest, at lightest
not much more than switching playfully.  Had there,
however, been nothing to plead for him but this, there would
have been no room for him here. <a id='sec9.2.27'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His parody-criticisms</i></span> But his favourite way of
proceeding in his lighter critical articles, though not invented
by himself (as it was not of course invented even by Canning
and his merry men, from whom Maginn took it), the method
of <a id='note488'></a><a href='#n_488'><ins class='note'>parody-criticism</ins></a>, is, if not a very high variety,
and especially not in the least a convincing one,
still one which perhaps deserves a few lines of reference, and
of which he was himself decidedly the chief master.  These
parody-criticisms<a id='r921'></a><a href='#f921' class='c010'><sup>[921]</sup></a> are often quite good-natured, and they
exhibit the seamy sides of the various styles in a manner
which is critical “after a sort.”</p>

<a id='sec9.2.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and more serious efforts.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Still, a mere allusion would suffice for them if they stood
alone, and Maginn’s paragraph might be completed by observing
that he has repaired the absolutely false statement,
that “Michael Angelo was a very indifferent
poet,” by the far too true one, that “Any modern
sermon, after  the  Litany  of  the Church of  England, is  an
extreme example of the bathos.”<a id='r922'></a><a href='#f922' class='c010'><sup>[922]</sup></a>  But his <cite>Essay on Dr
Farmer’s Learning of Shakespeare</cite>,<a id='r923'></a><a href='#f923' class='c010'><sup>[923]</sup></a> and the much shorter but
still substantial <cite>Lady Macbeth</cite>,<a id='r924'></a><a href='#f924' class='c010'><sup>[924]</sup></a> are by no means to be omitted
or merely catalogued.  These two pieces show that Maginn, if</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>only he could have kept his hand from the glass, and his pen
from mere gambols or worse, not only might but would have
been one of the most considerable of English critics.  The
goodness, and the various goodness, of both is all the more
remarkable because Maginn seems to have owed little or
nothing to the influence of Coleridge.  Almost the only fault
in the first is the hectoring incivility with which Farmer
himself is spoken of, and this, as we have seen, is but too old
a fault with critics, while it was specially prevalent at this
period, and our own is far from guiltless of it.  But the sense
and learning of the paper are simply admirable: and Maginn’s
possession of the last critical secret is almost shown by his
wise restraint in arguing that Farmer’s argument for Shakespeare’s
ignorance is invalid, without going on, as some would
do, and have done, to argue the poet omniscient by learning
as well as by genius.  As for the <cite>Lady Macbeth</cite>, the sense
is reinforced, and the learning (here not necessary) replaced,
by taste and subtlety of the most uncommon kind.  I do not
know a piece of dramatic character-criticism (no, not the
thousand-times-praised thing in <cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite>) more unerringly
delicate and right.  And this man, not, as the cackle
goes, by “neglect of genius,” by the wicked refusal of patrons
to patronise, not by anything of the kind, but by sheer lack of
self-command, wasted his time in vulgar journalism at the
worst, and with rare exceptions<a id='r925'></a><a href='#f925' class='c010'><sup>[925]</sup></a> in mere sport-making at the
best!</p>

<p class='c014'>We have been occupied since the beginning of this chapter
by men who, save in the case of Hartley Coleridge, were
closely connected with the periodical press, and owed almost
all their communication with the public to it.  We now come
to a pair, greater than any of them, who were indeed “contributors,”
but not contributors mainly.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Macaulay.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Another great name is added, by Macaulay, to the long and
pleasant list of our examples how “Phibbus car” has, in unexpected
and puzzling but always interesting ways, “made or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>marred the” not always  “foolish Fates” of critics and criticism.
When we first meet him as a critic of scarcely four-and-twenty,
in the articles contributed to <cite>Knight’s
Quarterly</cite>, we may feel inclined to say that nobody whom
we have yet met (except perhaps Southey) can have had at that
age a wider range of reading, and nobody at all an apparently
keener relish for it. <a id='sec9.2.30'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>His exceptional competence in some ways.</i></span> He is, what Southey was not, a competent
scholar in the classics; he knows later (if unfortunately
not quite earlier) English  literature  extraordinarily
well; he has, what was once common
with us, but was in his days getting rare, and has
since grown rarer, a pretty thorough knowledge of Italian, and he
is certainly not ignorant of French (though perhaps at no time
did he thoroughly relish its literature), while he is later to
add Spanish and German.  But he does not only know, he
loves.  There is already much personal rhetoric and mannerism
especially in the peroration of his review of Mitford’s <cite>Greece</cite>,
where he reproaches that Tory historian with his neglect of
Greek literature.  But it is quite evidently sincere.  He has
shown similar enthusiasm, combined in a manner not banal,
in his earlier article on Dante, and he shows wonderful and
prophetic knowledge of at least parts of literature in his
paper on the Athenian Orators, as well as in the later article
on History belonging to his more recognised literary period.
<a id='sec9.2.31'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The early articles.</i></span> From a candidate of this kind, but just qualified to be a
deacon of the Church in years, we may surely expect a
deacon in the craft of criticism before very long,
particularly when he happens to possess a ready-made
style of extraordinarily, and not merely, popular qualities.
There are some who would say that this expectation was fully
realised: I am afraid I cannot quite agree with them, and it
is my business here to show why.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His drawbacks.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We have said that, even in these early exercitations,
Macaulay’s characteristics appear strongly: and among not
the least strongly appearing are some from which,
unless a man disengages himself, he shall very hardly
become a really great literary critic.  The first of these is the
well-known and not seriously to be denied tendency, not merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>to “cocksureness,” but to a sweeping indulgence in superlatives,
a “knock-me-down-these-knaves” gesticulation,
which is the very negation of the critical attitude.  Even the
sound, the genuine, the well-deserved literary preferences
above referred to lose not a little by this tone of swaggering
sententiousness in their expression; and they lose a
great deal more by the simultaneous appearance of the hopelessly
uncritical habit of making the whites more dazzling
by splashing the deepest black alongside of them.  The very
eulogy of Dante as a whole seems to Macaulay incomplete
without an elaborate pendant of depreciation of Petrarch,
while “Tasso, Marino, Guarini, and Metastasio” are swept
into a dust-bin of common disdain, and we are told that the
<span lang="it"><i>Secchia Rapita</i></span>, “the best poem of its kind in some respects,”
is “painfully diffuse and languid,” qualities which one might
have thought destructive of any “bestness.”</p>

<a id='sec9.2.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The practical choking of the good seed.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is of less importance—because the fault is so common
as to be almost universal—that the “Mitford” displays very
strong political prejudice, which certainly affects,
as it should not do, the literary judgment.  Mitford
may have been an irregular and capricious writer,
but the worst vices of the worst Rymer-and-Dennis
criticism appear in the description of him as “bad.”
His style could not possibly be so described by a fair critic who
did not set out with the major premiss that whatever is unusual
is bad.  And not only here, but even in the purely literary essays,
even at their most enthusiastically literary pitch, we may, I
think, without any unfairness, perceive an undertone, an undercurrent,
of preference for the not purely literary sides of the
matter—for literature as it bears on history, politics, manners,
man, instead of for literature in itself and for itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the transference from <cite>Knight’s</cite> to the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, which
was political and partisan-political, or nothing, these seeds of
evil grew and nourished, and to some extent choked the others.
The “Milton,” the “Machiavelli,” the early and, for a long time,
uncollected “Dryden,” serve as very hot-beds for them.  All
three are, as the French would say, <span lang="la"><i>jonchés</i></span> with superlatives,
arranged side by side in contrast like that of a zebra.  The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>“Dryden”—a very tempting subject for this kind of work—is
not the worst critically; indeed it is perhaps the best.
It is, at any rate, far the most really literary, and it may
not be unfair to think that this had something to do with the
fact that Macaulay did not include it in the collected <cite>Essays</cite>.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His literary surveys in the</i> Letters.</div>

<p class='c001'>The real <span lang="la"><i>locus classicus</i></span>, however, for Macaulay’s criticism
is perhaps to be found, not in his published works at all, but
in the letters which he wrote to Flower Ellis from
Calcutta,<a id='r926'></a><a href='#f926' class='c010'><sup>[926]</sup></a> taken in connection with their context in
Sir George Trevelyan’s book, and especially with
the remarkable avowal which occurs in a letter, a very little
later, to Macvey Napier.  Macaulay, as is well known, availed
himself of his Indian sojourn to indulge in almost a debauch
of reading, especially in pure literature, and especially (again)
in the classics.  And his reflections to Ellis, a kindred spirit,
are of the most interesting kind.  He tells his correspondent
that he has gone back to Greek literature with a passion quite
astonishing to himself.  He had been enraptured with Italian,
little less pleased with Spanish, but when he went back to
Greek he felt as if he had never known before what intellectual
enjoyment was.  It is impossible to imagine a happier
critical <span lang="la"><i>diathesis</i></span>: and the individual symptoms confirm it.
Admiration of Æschylus is practically a passport for a
man claiming poetical taste: admiration of Thucydides holds
the same place in prose.  And Macaulay puts them both
<span lang="la"><i>super æthera</i></span>.  But it is a tell-tale that his admiration for
Thucydides (of whom he says he had formerly not thought
much) seems to have been determined by his own recent attention
to “historical researches and political affairs.”  He does
full justice to Lucian.  He is capital on Niebuhr: a good deal
less capital on the Greek Romances; for though Achilles Tatius
is not impeccable in taste and exceeding peccable in morality,
it is absurd to call his book “detestable trash.”  Perhaps he
is hard on Statius as compared with Lucan: but here taste
is free.  It is more difficult to excuse him for the remark that
St Augustine in his <cite>Confessions</cite> (a book not without interest)
“expresses himself in the style of a field-preacher.”  The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>present writer is not fond of conventicles, either house or
hedge. But if he knew of a field-preacher who preached as
St Augustine writes, he fears he might be tempted astray.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then, after the six months’ voyage home in the slow

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>You cannot suspect me of any affectation of modesty: and you
will therefore believe me that I tell you what I sincerely think,
when I say that I am not successful in analysing the effect of works
of genius. I have written several things on historical, political, and
moral questions of which, on the fullest reconsideration, I am not
ashamed, and by which I should be willing to be estimated; but
<em>I have never written a page of criticism on poetry or the fine arts
which I would not burn if I had the power</em>. Hazlitt used to say of
himself, “I am nothing if not critical.” The case with me is exactly
the reverse; I have a strong and acute enjoyment of works
of the imagination, but I have never habituated myself to dissect
them.... Trust to my knowledge of myself; I never in my life
was more certain of anything than of what I tell you, and I am sure
that Lord Jeffrey will tell you exactly the same.<a id='r927'></a><a href='#f927' class='c010'><sup>[927]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c025'>Such a deliberate judgment on himself by such a man, close
on the “age of wisdom,”<a id='r928'></a><a href='#f928' class='c010'><sup>[928]</sup></a> after fifteen years’ constant literary
practice, is practically final; but probably not a few readers
of Sir George’s book felt, as the present writer did, that it
merely confirms an opinion formed by themselves long before
they ever read it.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Essays.</div>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, in nearly all the best known <em>Essays</em> the
literary interest dwindles and the social-historic grows. I
do not object, as some do, to the famous “Robert
Montgomery.”  This sort of criticism ought not
to be done too often: and no one but a Dennis of the other
kind enjoys doing it, except when the criminal’s desert is of
peculiar richness. But it has to be done sometimes, and it
is here done scientifically, without rudeness I think, with as
much justice<a id='r929'></a><a href='#f929' class='c010'><sup>[929]</sup></a> as need be “for the good of the people,” and well.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Still, it is not in the hangman’s drudgery, it is in the herald’s
good office, that Macaulay’s critical weakness shows. There
are some who, in all good faith and honest indignation, will
doubtless cry <a id='corr494.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>“What!</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_494.4'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>“What!</ins></a></span> is there no literary interest in the
“Milton” itself or in the “Bunyan”? Certainly there is.
But, in the first case, let the Devil’s Advocate’s devil (it is
too easy for his chief) remind us that there is very strong
party feeling in both—that no less a person than Mr Matthew
Arnold denied criticism to the “Milton”—that the author
of the “Bunyan” himself puts in the forefront of his praise of
<cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite> its “strong <em>human</em> interest,” and that
he goes on to make one of his too frequent uncritical contrasts,
and one of his very rare gross blunders of fact, as to the
<cite>Faerie Queene</cite>. And, besides, he was still in the green tree,
as he was also when he gave the, in part, excellent criticism
of the “Byron,” where the sweeping general lines of the
sketch of the poetry of “correctness” follow those of some
inferior but more original surveys of Macaulay’s editor Jeffrey.
And though there is interesting criticism in the “Boswell,”
it is pushed to the wall by the (I fear it must be said) ignoble
desire to “dust the varlet’s jacket,” and pay Croker off in the
<cite>Edinburgh</cite> for blows received at St Stephen’s.<a id='r930'></a><a href='#f930' class='c010'><sup>[930]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed it would be quite idle to stipulate that anything here
said to the detriment of Macaulay’s criticism is said relatively,
if there were not a sort of doubtless honest folk who seem
to think that denying a man the riches of Crœsus means that
he is penniless and in debt. Macaulay <em>was</em> a critic on his
day—a good one for a long time, and perhaps always a great
one <span lang="la"><i>in potentia</i></span>. But his criticism was slowly edged out
by its rivals or choked by its own parasitic plants. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>occupies about a twentieth part (to adopt his own favourite
arithmetical method) of the Essay on Bacon, about one-tenth
of that on Temple. In the famous piece on “Restoration
Drama” it is the moral and social, not the literary or even
the dramatic, side of the matter that interests Macaulay: and
in dealing with Addison himself, a man who, though not quite
literary or nothing, was certainly literary first of all, the purely
literary handling is entirely subordinated to other parts of
the treatment. This may be a good thing or it may be a
bad thing: the <span lang="de"><cite>tendenz</cite></span>-critics, and the criticism-of-life
critics, and the others, are quite welcome to take the first view
if they please. But that it is a <em>thing</em>; that Macaulay himself
acknowledged it, and that—despite his unsurpassed devotion
to literature and his great performance therein—it must
affect our estimate of him, according to the schedules and
specifications of this book, is not, I think, deniable by any
honest inquirer.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Similar dwindling in Carlyle.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A phenomenon by no means wholly dissimilar in kind, but
conditioned as to extent and degree by the differing temperaments
and circumstances of the two men, may be
seen in the criticism of Macaulay’s great contemporary,
opposite, and corrective, Carlyle;<a id='r931'></a><a href='#f931' class='c010'><sup>[931]</sup></a> and those
who care for such investigations might find it interesting to
compare both with the admitted instances of dwindling literary
interest—not critical but simply enjoying—in cases like that
of Darwin. But leaving this extension as out of our province,
and returning to our two great men of letters themselves, we
shall find differences enough between them, here as elsewhere,
but a remarkable agreement in the gradual ascendancy obtained
by anthropology over (in the old and good sense, not the
modern perversion) philology. Carlyle had always the more
catholic, as Macaulay had the exacter, sense of literary form;
but it may be suspected that at no time was the form chiefly
eloquent to either: and in Carlyle’s attitude for many years
after the somewhat tardy commencement of his actual critical
career, something ominous may be observed. It may seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>strange and impious to some of those who acknowledge no
greater debt for mental stimulation to any one than to Carlyle,
and who rank him among the greatest in all literature, to find
one who joins them in this homage, and perhaps outgoes most
of them therein, questioning his position as a critic. Let us
therefore examine the matter somewhat carefully.</p>

<p class='c001'>Carlyle’s criticism, like his other qualities, interpenetrates
nearly all his work, from <cite>Sartor</cite> to the “Kings of Norway”:
it appears in the <cite>Life of Schiller</cite>,<a id='r932'></a><a href='#f932' class='c010'><sup>[932]</sup></a> in <cite>Heroes and Hero-Worship</cite>,
in <cite>Past and Present</cite>, in the <cite>Life of Sterling</cite>, while it
<em>fuliginates</em> itself to share in the general fuliginousness of the
<cite>Latter-day Pamphlets</cite>, and is strewn even over the greater
biographies and histories of the <cite>Cromwell</cite> and the <cite>Frederick</cite>.
We shall, however, lose nothing, and gain much, by confining
ourselves mainly to the literary constituents of the great collection
of <cite>Essays</cite> in this place. The discussion can be warranted
to be well leavened with remembrance of the other work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who indeed is more rememberable than Carlyle? Of late
years, partly from having read them so much, partly from
having so much else to read, I have left parts of these Essays
unopened for a long time. Yet, in looking them through for
the purpose of this present writing, I have found myself constantly,
even in the least familiar and famous parts, able to
shut the book and complete clause, sentence, or even to some
extent paragraph, like a text, or a collect, or a tag of Horace
or Virgil. But in this re-reading it has struck me, even more
forcibly than of old, how much Carlyle’s strictly critical inclinations,
if not his strictly critical <a id='corr496.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='faculities'>faculties</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_496.28'><ins class='correction' title='faculities'>faculties</ins></a></span>, waned as he
grew older. In the earlier Essays—those written before and
during the momentous period of the Craigenputtock sojourn—there
is a great deal of purely or almost purely literary criticism
of an excellent kind—sober and vigorous, fresh and well
disciplined. There may be, especially in regard to Richter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>Goethe, a slightly exaggerated backing of the German side.
But it is hardly more than slightly exaggerated, and the
treatment generally is of the most thorough kind compatible
with an avowed tendency towards “philosophical” rather than
“formal” criticism. Professor Vaughan was certainly justified
in including part of the <cite>Goethe</cite> in his selected specimens of
English criticism<a id='r933'></a><a href='#f933' class='c010'><sup>[933]</sup></a> for its general principles and examples of
method. Nor is Carlyle less to be praised for his discharge
of the more definitely practical part of the critic’s business.
He is thought of generally as “splenetic and rash”: but it
would be impossible to find anywhere a more good-humoured,
and (in parts at least) a more judicial censure than that of
William Taylor’s preposterous <cite>German Poetry</cite>,<a id='r934'></a><a href='#f934' class='c010'><sup>[934]</sup></a> or a firmer,
completer, and at the same time less excessive condemnation
than that of the equally preposterous method of Croker’s
original <cite>Boswell</cite>. We may see already that the critic evidently
prefers matter to form, and that he is by no means quite
catholic even in his fancy for matter. <a id='sec9.2.38'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The earlier</i> Essays.</span> But he has a right to
be this; and altogether there are few things in English criticism
better worth reading, marking, and learning,
by the novice, than the literary parts of these earlier
volumes of <cite>Essays</cite>.<a id='r935'></a><a href='#f935' class='c010'><sup>[935]</sup></a> It may be that the channels in which his
ink first flowed (especially that rather carefully, not to say
primly, banked and paved one of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>) imposed some
restriction on him; it may be that he found the yet unpublished,
or just published, <cite>Sartor</cite> a sufficient “lasher” to draw
off the superfluous flood and foam of his fancy. But the facts
are the facts.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.39'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The later.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And so, too, it is the fact that, later, he draws away from
the attitude of purely literary consideration, if he
does not, as he sometimes still later does, take up
one actually hostile to this. The interesting “Characteristics”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>(as early as 1831) is one of the places most to be recommended
to people who want to know what Carlyle really was, and not
what divers more or less wise or unwise commentators have
said of him. The writer has flings at literary art—especially
conscious literary art—towards the beginning: afterwards
(which is still more significant) he hardly takes any notice of it
at all. In the much better known “Boswell,” “Burns,” and
“Scott”<a id='r936'></a><a href='#f936' class='c010'><sup>[936]</sup></a> Essays, his neglect of the purely literary side is again
the more remarkable, because it is not ostentatious. In the
“Diderot,” dealing with a subject who was as much a man of
letters first of all (though of very various and <em>applied</em> letters)
as perhaps any man in history, he cannot and does not neglect
that subject’s literary performance; but the paper is evidence
of the very strongest how little of his real interest is bestowed
upon it. It is of the man Diderot—and of the man Diderot’s
relation to, and illumination of, that condition of the French
mind and state of which some good folk have thought that
Carlyle knew nothing—that he is thinking, for this that he
is caring. Later still, he will select for his favourite subjects
people like Mirabeau, who had much better have written no
books at all, or Dr Francia, whose connection with literature
is chiefly limited to the fact of his having written one immortal
sentence. And this sentence, not having myself seen or
wished to see the works of Rengger, I have always suspected
that Carlyle or “Sauerteig” edited for him.<a id='r937'></a><a href='#f937' class='c010'><sup>[937]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.2.40'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The attitude of the</i> Latter-day Pamphlets.</div>

<p class='c001'>And then things get worse. That invocation of the Devil
in the <cite>Latter-day Pamphlets</cite>,<a id='r938'></a><a href='#f938' class='c010'><sup>[938]</sup></a> “to fly away with
the poor Fine Arts,” is indeed put off on “one of
our most distinguished public men.” But Carlyle
avows sympathy with it. He even progresses
from it to the Platonic view  that “Fiction” at all “is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>quite a permissible thing”—is “sparingly permissible” at
any rate. “Homer” was meant for “history”:<a id='r939'></a><a href='#f939' class='c010'><sup>[939]</sup></a> the arts
were not “sent into the world to fib and dance.” As for
Literature more particularly, “if it continue to be the haven
of expatriated spiritualisms,” well: but “if it dwindle, as <em>is
probable</em>, into mere merry-andrewism, windy twaddle, and
feats of spiritual legerdemain,” there “will be no hope for
it.” Its “regiment” is “extremely miscellaneous,” “more
a <span lang="fr"><i>canaille</i></span> than a regiment,” and so forth. The “brave young
British man” is adjured to be “rather shy of Literature than
otherwise, for the present,”—a counsel which, it is well known,
Mr Carlyle repeated in his Edinburgh Rectorial address sixteen
years later. Nor did he ever alter the point of view which
he had now taken up, either in book, or minor published work,
or Letters, or autobiographic jottings, or those <em>Ana</em> which still
flit on the mouths of men concerning his later years.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The conclusion of this matter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A man who speaks thus, and thinks thus, has perforce renounced
the development of any skill that he may once have
had in the analysis of the strands of the tight-rope,
or the component drugs of the Cup of Abominations.
Still less can he be expected to expatiate,
with the true critic’s delight, on the elegance with which
the dancer pirouettes over vacancy, or on the iridescent richness
of the wine of Circe, as it moveth itself in the chalice.
I do not know that—great critic, really, as he had been earlier
and always might have been—the loss of his services in this
function is much to be regretted. For he did other things
which assuredly most merely literary critics could not have
done: and not a few good workmen stepped forward, in the
last thirty years of his life, to do the work which he thus left
undone, not without some flouting and scorning of it. But,
once more, the fact is the fact: and his estrangement from
the task, like that of Macaulay, undoubtedly had something
to do with the general critical poverty of the period of English
literature, which was the most fertile and vigorous in the
literary life of both.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.42'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Thackeray.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Another of the very greatest gods of mid-nineteenth century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>literature in England displays the slightly anti-critical turn
of his time still more curiously. It is one of the
oddest and most interesting of the many differences
between the two great masters of English prose fiction in the
mid-nineteenth century that, while there is hardly any critical
view of literature in Dickens, Thackeray is full of such views.<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c010'><sup>[940]</sup></a>
He himself practised criticism early and late; and despite
the characteristic and perhaps very slightly affected depreciation
of the business of “reading books and giving judgment
on them,” which appears in <cite>Pendennis</cite> and other places, it is
quite clear that he pursued that business for love as well
as for money. Moreover, from first to last,—from his early
and long uncollected “High-Jinkish” exploits in <cite>Fraser</cite> to
the <cite>Roundabout Papers</cite>,—he produced critical work from which
an anthology of the very finest critical quality, and by no
means small in bulk, might be extracted with little pains
and no little pleasure. <a id='sec9.2.43'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His one critical weakness</i></span> If he “attains not unto the first
three,” it is I think only from the effect of the reaction or
ebb that we note in this chapter, and from a certain deficiency
in that catholic sureness which a critic of the
highest kind can hardly lack. Nobody is obliged
to like everything good; probably no one <em>can</em> like
everything good. But, in case of disliking, the critic must
be able either to give reasons (like those of Longinus in regard
to the <cite>Odyssey</cite>) relatively, if not positively, satisfactory: or
he must frankly admit that his objections are based upon
something extra-literary, and that therefore, in strictness, he
has no literary judgment to give.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now Thackeray does not do this. He was not, perhaps,
very good at giving reasons at all: and he was specially
affected by that confusion of literary and extra-literary considerations
from which all times suffer, but from which his own
time and party—the moderate Liberals of the mid-nineteenth
century in England—suffered more than any time or party
known to us. Practically we have his confession, in the famous
and dramatically paradoxical sentence on Swift, that, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>he is the greatest of the Humourist company, “I say we should
hoot him.” The literary critic who has “got salvation” knows
that he must never do this—that whatever his dislike for
the man—Milton, Racine, Swift, Pope, Rousseau, Byron,
Wordsworth (I purposely mix up dislikes which are with
those which are not mine)—he must not allow them to colour
his judgment of the writer. <cite>Gulliver</cite> may be a terrible,
humiliating, heart-crushing indictment, but nothing can prevent
it from being a glorious <em>book</em>: and so on. Now Thackeray, by
virtue of that quality of his, different sides of which have
been—with equal lack of wisdom perhaps—labelled “cynicism”
and “sentimentality,” was wont to be very “peccant
in this kind,” and it, with some, though less, purely political
or religious prejudice, and a little caprice, undoubtedly flawed
his criticism.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.44'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and excellence.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>When, however, these outside disturbers kept quiet, as they
very often did, Thackeray’s criticism is astonishingly catholic
and sound, and sometimes he was able to turn the
disturbers themselves out. He had a most unhappy
and Philistine dislike of the High Church movement: yet the
passage in <cite>Pendennis</cite> on <cite>The Christian Year</cite> is one of the sacred
places of sympathetic notice. The well-known <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> in <cite>The Newcomes</cite>,
as to the Colonel’s horror at the new literary gods, shows
how sound Thackeray’s own faith in them was: yet he, least
of all men, could be accused of forsaking the old. He had that
generous appreciation of his own fellow-craftsmen by which
novelists have been honourably distinguished from poets:
though not all poets have been jealous, and though, from
Richardson downwards, there have been very jealous novelists.
If there were more criticism like the famous passage on Dumas
in the <cite>Roundabouts</cite>, like great part of the solid <cite>English
Humourists</cite>, like much elsewhere, our poor Goddess would
not be liable to have her comeliness confounded with the
ugliness of her personators, as is so often the case. And his
is no promiscuous and undiscriminating generosity. He can
“like nicely,” and does.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, though he has sometimes escaped the disadvantages of
his temperament, he has often succumbed to those of his time;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>and what those disadvantages were cannot be better shown
than by an instance to which we may now turn.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.45'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Blackwood, <i>in 1849, on Tennyson</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>When, in writing a little book upon Mr Matthew Arnold,<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c010'><sup>[941]</sup></a> the
present writer spoke severely of the state of English criticism
between 1830 and 1860, some protests were made, as
though the stricture were an instance of that “unfairness
to the last generation” which has been
frequently noticed, and invariably deprecated and condemned
here. I gave, on that occasion, some illustrative instances;<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c010'><sup>[942]</sup></a>
I may here add another and very remarkable one, which I
had not at that time studied. In April 1849 there appeared
in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> an article of some length on Tennyson’s
work, which at the time consisted of the revised and consolidated
<cite>Poems</cite> of 1842 (still further castigated in the one-volume
form, so familiar to the youth of my generation), and of <cite>The
Princess</cite>. This article<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c010'><sup>[943]</sup></a> is not in the least uncivil—“Maga”
had now outgrown her hoydenish ways: but we do not find the
maturer, yet hardly less attractive, graces of the <span lang="fr"><i>trentaine</i></span>. The
writer proclaims himself blind and deaf at every moment. He
misses—he positively blasphemes—the beauty of many things
that Wilson had frankly welcomed. He selects for praise such
second—or third-rate matter as <cite>The Talking Oak</cite>. <cite>Claribel</cite>, not
Tennyson’s greatest thing, but the very Tennyson in germ,
“leaves as little impression on the living ear as it would on
the sleeper beneath.” The exquisite <cite>Ode to Memory</cite>, with all
its dreamy loveliness, is “an utter failure throughout,” it is a
“mist” “coloured by no ray of beauty.” But the critic is
made most unhappy by the song “A spirit haunts the last
year’s bowers.” It is “an odious piece of pedantry.” Its admirable
harmony, at once as delightful and as true to true
English prosody as verse can be, extracts from him the remark,
“What metre, Greek or Roman, Russian or Chinese, it was
intended to imitate, we have no care to inquire: the man
was writing English, and had no justifiable pretence for torturing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>our ears with verse like this.” The <cite>Lady of Shalott</cite> is
“intolerable,” “odious,” “irritating,” “an annoyance,” “a
caprice”: anybody who likes it “must be far gone in dilettanteism.”
Refrains are “melancholy iterations.” With a rather
pleasing frankness the critic half confesses that he knows he
ought to like the <cite>Marianas</cite>, but wholly declares that he does
not. He likes the <cite>Lotos-Eaters</cite>, so that he cannot have been
congenitally deprived of <em>all</em> the seven senses of Poetry; but he
cannot even form an idea what “the horse with wings kept
down by its heavy rider” means in the <cite>Vision of Sin</cite>, and he
cannot away with the <cite>Palace</cite> and the <cite>Dream</cite>, now purged, let
it be remembered, of their “balloons” and Groves-of-Blarney
stanzas, and in their perfect beauty. “Giving himself away,”
in the fatal fashion of such censors, he does not merely in effect
pronounce them both with rare exceptions “bad and unreadable,”
but selects the magnificent line—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Throb through the ribbed stone”—</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>for special ridicule. “To hear one’s own voice throbbing
through the ribbed stone is a startling novelty in acoustics,”
which simply shows, not merely that he had never heard his
own or any other voice singing under a vaulted roof, but that
he had not the mite of imagination necessary for conceiving
the effect. With <cite>The Princess</cite>, as less <em>pure</em> poetry—good as
it is—he is less unhappy; but he is not at all comfortable
there.</p>

<p class='c001'>To do our critic justice, however, though it makes his case
a still more leading one, he is not one of the too common
carpers who string a reasonless “I don’t like this” to a tell-tale
“I can’t understand that,” until they can twist a ball (not
of cowslips) to fling at a poet. He has, or thinks he has, a
theory: and in some respects his theory is not a bad one.
He admits that “the subtle play of imagination” may be “the
most poetical part of a poem,” that it may “constitute the difference
between poetry and prose,” which is good enough. But he
thinks you may have too much of this good thing, that it may
be “too much divorced from those sources of interest which
affect all mankind”; and he thinks, further, that this divorce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>has taken place, not merely in Tennyson, but in Keats and in
Shelley. Yet, again, as has been indeed already made evident,
he has not in the least learnt the secret of that prosodic
freedom, slowly broadened down from precedent to precedent of
early Middle English writers, and Chaucer, and the Balladists,
and Spenser, and Shakespeare, and Milton, and Coleridge, which
it is the glory of the nineteenth century to have perfected. And
he detests the new poetic diction, aiming at the utmost reach of
visual as well as musical appeal, which came with this freedom.
His recoil from the “jingling rhythm” throws him with a
shudder against the “resplendent gibberish.” In other words,
he is not at focus: he is outside. He can neither see nor hear:
and therefore he cannot judge.</p>

with indistinct results, at first.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.46'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>George Brimley.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I hardly know a book more interesting to the real student
of real criticism than George Brimley’s <span lang="fr"><i>Essays</i></span>.<a id='r944'></a><a href='#f944' class='c010'><sup>[944]</sup></a> That it gives
us, with Matthew Arnold’s earliest work, the first
courses of the new temple of English Criticism is
something, but its intrinsic attraction is its chief. The writer
was apparently able to devote his short but not unhappy life,
without let or hindrance other than that of feeble health, to
literature; he was unhampered by any distracting desire to
create; he could judge and enjoy with that almost uncanny
calmness which often results, in happy dispositions, from the
beneficent effect of the <span lang="fr"><i>mal physique</i></span>, freed from the aggravation
of the <span lang="fr"><i>mal moral</i></span>.<a id='r945'></a><a href='#f945' class='c010'><sup>[945]</sup></a> He has idols; but he breaks away from
them, if he does not quite break them. He puts no others
in their places, as Arnold did too often: and, like Dryden
(though they had no other point of resemblance than in both
being admirable critics, and both members of Trinity College,
Cambridge), he never goes wrong without coming right, with
a force and vehemence of leap only intensified by his recoil.
In his best work, what should be the famous, and is, to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>who know it, the delightful, Essay on Tennyson, we have a
thing profitable at once for example, for reproof, and for instruction,
as few critical things are.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.47'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His Essay on Tennyson.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We find him at the opening a little joined to one idol, that
apparently respectable, but infinitely false, god, the belief that
the poet must somehow or other deal with modern life.<a id='r946'></a><a href='#f946' class='c010'><sup>[946]</sup></a> Even
from this point of view he will not give up Tennyson, but he
apologises for him, and he colours nearly all his remarks on
at least the early <cite>Poems</cite> by the apologies. He cannot shake
himself quite free. He sees the beauty of <cite>Claribel</cite>: but he
will not allow its beauty to be its sole duty. It “is not quite
certain what the precise feeling of it is,” and “no poem ought
to admit of such a doubt.” No music of verse, no pictorial
power, “will enable a reader to care for such ‘creatures of the
fancy’” as Margaret or Eleanore, as the Sea Fairies, and many
others. “<em>If</em> expression were the highest aim
of poetry,” <em>Mariana</em> would be consummate:
but—--! Mr Tennyson “moved in the centre of
the most distinguished young men of the University,” “yet his
poems present faint evidences of this,” strange to say! <em>The
Miller’s Daughter</em>, and <em>The Gardener’s Daughter</em>, and <em>The May
Queen</em> are dwelt on at great length, and with an evident feeling
that here is something you can recommend to a practical
friend who cannot embrace day-dreams. <em>Mariana in the
South</em> should “connect itself more clearly with a person
brought before the mind”—with a certificate of birth, let us
say, and something about her parentage, and the bad man
who left her, and the price of beans and garlic in the next
village. <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> “eliminates all human interest.”
<em>Fatima</em>, justly admired, “has neither beginning, middle, or
end.” <em>The Palace of Art</em> has “no adequate <em>dramatic</em> presentation
of the mode in which the great law of humanity works
out its processes in the soul.” [So lyric poets, we understand,
are <em>not</em> entitled to speak lyrically: but must write drama!]
And, greatest shock of all, <cite>The Dream of Fair Women</cite> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>not so much as mentioned. When Brimley wrote it had
long shaken off its earlier crudities,—had attained its final
symmetry. It was there, entire and perfect, from the exquisite
opening, through the matchless blended shiftings of life and
literature, woven into one passionate whole, to those last two
stanzas which give the motto of Life itself from youth to age,
the <span lang="fr"><i>raison d'être</i></span> of Heaven, the undying sting of Hell, the
secret of the peace that grows on the soul through Purgatory.
And the critic says nothing about it!</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet he has justified his instinct—if not quite his cleared
vision—from the first. Of <cite>Claribel</cite> itself, of the <cite>Marianas</cite>,
of <cite>The Lotos-Eaters</cite>, of the <cite>Palace</cite>, he has given analytic
appreciations so enthusiastic, and at the same time so just,
so solidly thought, and so delicately phrased, that there is
nothing like them in Mr Arnold (who was rather grudging of
such things), and nothing superior to them anywhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a priceless wavering, a soul-saving “suppose it were
true?” in that “If” (most virtuous of its kind!),—“<em>If</em> expression
were the highest aim of poetry,” nor do I think it
fanciful to see in the blasphemy about music and painting <em>not</em>
saving “creatures of the fancy,” a vain protest against the conviction
that they <em>do</em>. Where he can get his prejudice and his
judgment to run in couples—as in regard to <cite>Locksley Hall</cite>—the
car sweeps triumphantly from start to finish, out of all
danger from the turning pillar. When he comes to <cite>Maud</cite>
(which the folk who had the prejudice, but not the judgment,
were blaspheming at the very moment at which he wrote), he
turns on them with a vehemence almost inconsistent—but with
the blessed inconsistency which is permissible—and lays it
down plump and plain, that “it is well not to be frightened
out of the enjoyment of fine poetry ... by such epithets
as morbid, hysterical, spasmodic.” Most true, and it would be
still better to add “beginning,” “middle,” “end,” “not human,”
the neglect of acquaintance with the most distinguished young
men of the university, the absence of dramatic presentation,
and the rest of them, to the herd of bogies that should first be
left to animate swine, and then be driven into the deep. Once,
indeed, afterwards he half relapses, observing that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>“incongruity” in <cite>The Princess</cite>. But his nerves have grown
firmer from his long bath of pure poetry, and he agrees to make
the best of it.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.48'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His other work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This “Tennyson” essay is one of a hundred pages, though
not very large ones: but the only other piece of length which
has been preserved, a paper on “Wordsworth” not
much shorter than the “Tennyson,” is, as was perhaps
natural, seeing that it was published immediately after
the poet’s death, mainly biographical, and so uninteresting:
while the remaining contents of the volume are short reviews.
The “Wordsworth” starts, however, with reasoned estimates
of Byron, Scott, and Shelley, as foils to Wordsworth: and
to these, remembering their time,<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c010'><sup>[947]</sup></a> the very middle of the
century, we turn with interest. The “Byron” and the “Scott”
reward us but moderately: they are in the main “what he
ought to have said,”—competent, well-balanced, true enough as
far as they go, but showing no very individual grip. The
Shelley, a better test, is far more satisfactory in the result. It
is quite clear that Brimley sympathised neither with Shelley’s
religious views, nor with his politics, nor with his morals. He
may be thought to be even positively unjust in saying that
Shelley’s “mind was ill-trained, and not well furnished with
facts,” for <em>intellectually</em> few poets have been better off in this
respect. Yet, in spite of all this, he says, “with one exception
a more glorious poet has not been given to the English nation,”
which once more shows how very much sounder he was on
the subject of poetry than Arnold, and how little beginnings,
and middles, and ends, with all their trumpery, really mattered
to him. Among the shorter pieces, the attempts at abstract,
or partly abstract, treatment in “Poetry and Criticism” and
“The Angel in the House” (only part of which latter is actually
devoted to its amiable but rather wool-gathering title-subject)
are not conspicuously successful; they are, in fact, trial-essays,
by a comparative novice, in an art the secrets of which had
been almost lost for nearly a generation. But the attempt in
“Poetry and Criticism” to gather up, squeeze out, and give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>form to the Coleridgean vaguenesses (for that is very much
what it comes to), has promise and germ. As for the smaller
reviews, Mr Brimley had the good fortune to deal as a reviewer
with Carlyle, Thackeray, and Dickens, as well as Bulwer and
Kingsley, not to mention such different subjects as the <cite>Noctes
Ambrosianæ</cite> and the <cite>Philosophie Positive</cite>: and the merit of
coming out, with hardly a stain upon his character, from any
one of these (in some cases very high) trials. We may think
that he does not always go fully right; but he never goes
utterly wrong. And when we think what sorrowful chances
have awaited the collision of great books at their first appearance
even with by no means little critics, the praise is not
small.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.49'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His intrinsic and chronological importance.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet a sufficient study of the “Tennyson” essay should have
quite prepared the expert reader for these minor successes.
Brimley, as we have said, was only partially favoured
by time, place, and circumstance, even putting
health out of the question. He was heavily handicapped
in that respect: and he had no time to work
out his critical deliverance fully, and to justify it by abundant
critical performance. But he has the root of the matter in him:
and it throws out the flower of the matter in that refusal to
be “frightened out of the enjoyment of fine poetry by epithets.”
When a man has once shown himself <span lang="la"><i>ausus contemnere vana</i></span>
in this way, when he has the initial taste which Brimley everywhere
shows, and the institution of learning which he did not
lack, it will go hard but he is a good critic <span lang="la"><i>in posse</i></span> already,
and harder if he is not a good one in such actuality as is
allowed him. And this was well seen of George Brimley.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.50'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>“<cite>Gyas and Cloanthus.</cite>”</div>

<p class='c001'>It is one of the penalties, late but heavy, of an attempt to
take a kingdom (even one not of Heaven) by storm for the
first time, that you have to “refuse” or “mask”
not a few of its apparently strong places—and if
their strength be more than apparent, the adventurer will not
be conqueror. There are in English, as in other nineteenth-century
literatures, many persons who addressed themselves
more or less seriously to criticism, who obtained more or less
name as critics, with whose works every well-read person is
more or less acquainted, yet who must be so refused or masked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>at the writer’s peril of the reader’s disappointment or disapproval.
Many of them seemed to be pillars of the early
and middle nineteenth-century reviews; from some of them,
no doubt, some institution in criticism has been received by
readers of all the three generations which have passed since
the appearance of the earliest. <a id='sec9.2.51'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Milman, Croker, Hayward.</i></span> It may seem intolerable <span lang="fr"><i>outrecuidance</i></span>
to put Milman and Croker and Hayward,
Sydney Smith and Senior and Helps, with others
not even named, as it were “in the fourpenny box”
of our stall. Yet it is unavoidable, and the stall-keeper must
dare it, not merely—not even mainly—because he has no room
to give them better display. Milman was at least thought
by Byron a formidable enough critic to have the apocryphal
crime of “killing John Keats” assigned to him by hypothesis:
and his merits (not of the bravo kind) are no doubt much
greater than the bad critics who, after Macaulay, depreciate
his style, and the maladroit eulogists of his free thought, who
would make him a sort of nineteenth-century Conyers Middleton,
appear to think. But he has no critical credential, known to
the present writer, that would give him substantive place
here.<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c010'><sup>[948]</sup></a> Croker was neither such a bad man nor such a bad
writer as Macaulay would have had him to be: but he was
almost as much more of a bravo than Milman as he was
less of a scholar. Senior, before he became a glorified earwig,
or, if this seem disrespectful, the father of all such as interview,
was a sound, if not very gifted, reviewer, but little more: Hayward,
a much cleverer and, above all, much more
worldly wise Isaac Disraeli, who made the most of
being “in society” (see Thackeray), talked better
than he wrote, but still wrote well, especially by
the aid of <span lang="fr"><i>l’esprit des autres</i></span>. <a id='sec9.2.52'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Sydney Smith, Senior, Helps.</i></span> Of Sydney Smith earlier, and
Sir Arthur Helps later, the fairest thing to say in our
present context is, that neither held himself out as a literary
critic at all. Sydney could give admirable accounts of books:
but he nowhere shows, or pretends to, the slightest sense of
literature. Helps, starting<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c010'><sup>[949]</sup></a> a discussion on Fiction,—the very
most interesting and most promising of all literary subjects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>for a man of his time—a subject which was just equipped with
material enough at hand, and not yet too much, neither novel
to the point of danger nor stale to the point of desperation,—“keeps
to the obvious,” as one of his own characters acknowledges,
in a fashion almost excusing the intrinsically silly
reaction from obviousness, which distinguished the last quarter
of the century, and is now getting obviously stale itself. The
influence of works of fiction is unbounded. The Duke of Marlborough
took his history from Shakespeare. Fiction is good
as creating sympathy. It is bad as leading us into dreamland.
Real life is more real than fiction. Writers of fiction have
great responsibility. In shorter formula, “We love our Novel
with an N because it is Nice; we hate it because it is sometimes
Naughty; we take it to the Osteria<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c010'><sup>[950]</sup></a> of the Obvious, and
treat it with an Olio of Obligingness and Objurgation.” But
Helps, in this very passage, tells us that he prefers life to
literature, and no one can be a good critic who, <em>when he
criticises</em>, does that: though he may be a very bad one, and
yet make the other preference.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.53'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Elwin, Lancaster, Hannay.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We must still extend this <span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span> a little in order to do
that justice—unjust at the best—which is possible here, and
which is yet not quite so futile and inadequate as
some still more unjust judgments would have it.
For the object of this History is to revive and
keep before the eye of the reader the names, the critical position,
and, if only by touches, the critical personality, of as
many of those who have done good service to criticism in the
past as may be possible. A little less wilfulness and exclusiveness
of personal taste, or rather less opportunity of indulging
it, would probably have made of Whitwell Elwin—who survived
till the earlier portion of this book was published, but
did his critical work long ago—a really great critic. Even
as it is, his <cite>Remains</cite><a id='r951'></a><a href='#f951' class='c010'><sup>[951]</sup></a> contain some of the best critical essays,
not absolutely supreme, to be found among the enormous
stores of the nineteenth century, especially on the most <cite>English</cite>
Englishmen of letters during the eighteenth, such as Fielding
and Johnson. A short life, avocations of business, and perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>the absence of the pressure of professional literary occupation,
prevented the work of Henry Lancaster<a id='r952'></a><a href='#f952' class='c010'><sup>[952]</sup></a> from being much
more than a specimen: but his famous essay on Thackeray
showed (and not alone) what he could do. On the other hand,
the not always mischievous, though too often galling, yoke of
the profession was not wanting to James Hannay. His literary
work was directed into too many paths, some of them too much
strewn with the thorns and beset with the briars of journalism.
But there are very few books of the kind which unite a certain
“popularity” in no invidious sense, and an adaptation for the
general reader, with sound and keen criticism, as does his far
too little known <cite>Course of English Literature</cite>;<a id='r953'></a><a href='#f953' class='c010'><sup>[953]</sup></a> while many of
his scattered and all but lost essays show admirable insight.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.54'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Dallas.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To one remarkable critic, however, who, though a younger
man than Mr Arnold, is on the whole of a Præ-Arnoldian type,
and to whom justice, I think, has not usually been
done, a little larger space must be given. I  must
admit that, having been disgusted at the time of the appearance
of <cite>The Gay Science</cite><a id='r954'></a><a href='#f954' class='c010'><sup>[954]</sup></a> by what I then thought its extremely
silly, and now think its by no means judicious, title, I never
read it until quite recently, and then found (of course) that
Mr Dallas had said several of my things before me, though
usually with a difference.<a id='r955'></a><a href='#f955' class='c010'><sup>[955]</sup></a> But I have not the least inclination
to say <span lang="la"><i>Pereat</i></span>: on the contrary, I should like to revive
him. <a id='sec9.2.55'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>The</i> Poetics.</span> Fourteen years earlier than the date of his principal
book, as a young man fresh from the influence of the Hamiltonian
philosophy, and also, I think, imbued with not a little
of Ruskinism, he had written a volume of <cite>Poetics</cite>,<a id='r956'></a><a href='#f956' class='c010'><sup>[956]</sup></a> which,
though it does not come to very much, is a remarkable
book, and a very remarkable one, it we consider
its date—a year before Mr Arnold’s <cite>Preface</cite>, and when Brimley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>and others were only waking up by fits, and starts, and relapses,
to the necessity of a new criticism. Not that Dallas is on the
right track: but he is on a track very different from that of
most English critics since Coleridge. He revives, in an odd way,—odd,
at least, till we remember the Philistinism of the First
Exhibition period,—the Apologetic for Poetry; he establishes,
rather in the old scholastic manner, the distinction between
Poetry the principle and Poesy the embodiment: he talks about
the “Law of Activity,” the “Law of Harmony,” and the like.</p>

<a id='sec9.2.56'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Gay Science.</div>

<p class='c001'>There is, for the time, not a little promise in this: and there
is much more, as well as some, if not quite enough, performance,
in the later book. <cite>The Gay Science</cite> (an adaptation,
of course, of the Provençal name for Poetry
itself) was originally intended to be in four volumes: but the
reception of the two first was not such as to encourage the
author—who had by this time engaged in journalism, and
become a regular writer for <cite>The Times</cite>—to finish it. I cannot
agree with the author of the article in the <cite>D. N. B.</cite>, that the
cause of its ill-success was its “abstruseness”: for really there
is nothing difficult about it. On the contrary, it is, I should
say, rather too much in the style of the leading article—facile,
but a little “woolly.” Its faults seem to lie partly in this,
but more in the two facts that, in the first place, the author
“embraces more than he can grasp”; and that, in the second,
he has not kept pace with the revival of criticism, though
he had in a manner anticipated it. He knows a good deal;
and he not only sees the necessity of comparative criticism,
but has a very shrewd notion of the difference between
the true and the false Comparisons. Acuteness in perception
and neatness in phrase appear pretty constantly: and he certainly
makes good preparation for steering himself right, by
deciding that Renaissance criticism is too verbal (he evidently
did not know the whole of it, but is right so far); German too
idealist; Modern generally too much lacking in system. Yet,
when he comes to make his own start, he “but yaws neither.”
He is uncomfortable with Mr Arnold (who, by this time, had
published not merely the <cite>Preface</cite> but the <cite>Essays in Criticism</cite>),
and finds fault with him, more often wrongly than rightly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>Especially he shows himself quite at a loss to comprehend
Sainte-Beuve, whom he, like some later persons, hardly thinks
a critic at all.<a id='r957'></a><a href='#f957' class='c010'><sup>[957]</sup></a> He gets boldly into the “<em>psycho</em>logical coach,”
and books himself, as resolutely as any German, for the City
of Abstraction. “The theory of imitation,” we are told, “is
now utterly exploded”—a remarkable instance of saying nearly
the right thing in quite the wrong way. We travel arm-in-arm
with “Imagination” and “The Hidden Soul” (which
seems to be something like Unconscious Cerebration); we hear
even more than from Mr Arnold about the “Play of Thought”;
we have chapters on chapters about Pleasure—not the specially
poetic pleasure, but pleasure in general. In short, we are here
in the presence, not so much of what we have called “metacritic”
as of something that might almost better be called
“<em>pro</em>critic”—altogether in the vestibule of critical inquiries
proper. Of course it is fair to remember the two unwritten
or unpublished volumes. But I venture very much to doubt,
from a perusal of both his published works, whether Dallas
would have ever thoroughly “collected” his method, or have
directed it to that actual criticism of actual literature, of which,
however (as of most things), there are fragments and essays
in his work. The disturbing influences which, as we have
seen, acted on so many of his contemporaries or immediate
seniors acted differently on him, but they acted: and his
literary “ideation” was, I think, too diffuse to make head
completely against them. Yet he had real critical talent:
and it is a pity that it has not had more adequate recognition.</p>

from a man of Scottish blood, though
every  Englishman  would  commit  it,
as I own I should have done till very
late in my reviewing life. It is the
satire on the comparison of a woman’s
eyes to dew on “a bramble,” which
of course in  England  means a <em>bush</em>,
and in Scotland a <em>berry</em>. I wonder
whether R. L. S. meant to appease the
other poor Robert’s <span lang="la"><i>manes</i></span> when he
wrote the phrase “eyes of gold and
bramble-dew,” and I should have asked
him had Fate permitted.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f930'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r930'>930</a>. It may seem whimsical: but I
doubt whether any one of a really
critical <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span> would put down, even in
his private diary, that a private enemy
and a hostile reviewer was “a bad,
a very bad man, a scandal to politics

Carlyle’s <span lang="la"><i>potentia</i></span> as a literary critic
may be specially commended to this.
It was written, of course, not merely
before he developed his own style, but
before the freer modern criticism had
been largely developed by anybody
except apart-dwelling stars like Coleridge.
But it brands the author as a
great critic <em>if he chose</em>. He did not
wholly choose: and, later, he refused.</p>

preposterous.  He and others of the

not <em>hostile</em>, he is simply puzzled. The
great method, which emerges first in

<div class='footnote' id='f958'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r958'>958</a>. Foster’s interest in literature—real,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r961'>961</a>. See his <cite>Early Essays</cite> in Bohn’s
reprint. The criticism of certain romantic
poets of the mid century would
make an interesting excursus of the
kind which I have indicated as (if it
were possible) fit to be included in a
fourth volume of this work. Horne’s
<cite>New Spirit of the Age</cite> (1845), though
exhibiting all the singular inadequacies,
inequalities, and <em>inorganicisms</em> of  the
author of <cite>Orion</cite>, does not entirely deserve
the severe contrast which Thackeray
drew between it and its original
as  given by  Hazlitt. Mrs Browning,
who took some part in this, has left
a substantive critical contribution in
<cite>The Greek Christian Poets and the
English Poets</cite>, in which again the weaknesses
of the writer in poetry are interestingly
compensated by weaknesses
in criticism, but in which again also,
and much more, “the critic whom
every poet must [or should] contain”
sometimes asserts himself not unsuccessfully.
W. C. Roscoe, whose verse
is at least interesting, and has been
thought something more, is critically
not negligible. But perhaps the most
interesting document which would have
to be treated in such an excursus is
Sydney Dobell’s <cite>Nature of Poetry</cite>, delivered
as a lecture (it must have
been something of a choke-pear for
the audience) at Edinburgh in 1857.
Here the author, though not <span lang="la"><i>nominatim</i></span>,
directly traverses Matthew Arnold’s
doctrine in the great Preface
(see next chapter), by maintaining that
a perfect poem <em>will be</em> the exhibition
of a perfect mind, and, we may suppose,
a less perfect but still defensible
poem the exhibition of a less perfect
mind—which principle, no doubt, is,
in any case, the sole possible justification
of <cite>Festus</cite> and of <cite>Balder</cite>. Others
(especially Sir Henry Taylor) might be
added, but these will probably suffice.</p>

<p class='c025'>In coming to Mr Matthew Arnold we come again, but for the
last time, to one of our chiefs of the greater clans of criticism.
<span lang="la"><i>Vixere fortes post</i></span> Mr Arnold; let us hope that
<span lang="la"><i>vivunt</i></span>. We have heard, more or less vaguely, of
new schools of criticism since, in more countries
than one or two, and an amiable enthusiasm has
declared that the new gospels are real gospels, far truer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>and better than any previously known. I am not myself,
by any means, in general agreement—I am often in very
particular disagreement—with Mr Arnold’s critical canons,
and (less often) with his individual judgments. But as I
rest on my oars, and look back over European criticism for
the eighty years which have passed since his birth, I cannot
find one critic, born since that time, who can be ranked above
or even with him in general critical quality and accomplishment.
And, extending the view further over the vast expanse
down which we have already travelled, though I certainly find
greater critics—critics very much greater in originality, greater
in catholicity, perhaps greater in felicity of individual utterance—I
yet find that he is of their race and lineage, free of
their company, one of them, not to be scanted of any sizings
that have been, by however unworthy a manciple, allotted to
them here.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that of these greater critics some have, at
this or that period of their career, launched a kind of manifesto
or confession, of which their other critical work is
but, as it were, the application and amplification:
while others have never done this, but have built
up their critical temple, adding wing to wing and storey to
storey, not seldom even deserting or ruining the earlier constructions.
Mr Arnold, in practice as in principle, belonged
to the first class, and he launched his own manifesto about as
early as any man can be capable of forming a critical judgment
which is not a mere adaptation of some one else’s, or (a thing
really quite as unoriginal) a flying-in-the-face of some one
else’s, or a mere spurt and splash of youthful self-sufficiency.
You can be a bishop and a critic at thirty—not before (by
wise external rule) in the former case; hardly before, according
to laws of nature which man has unwisely omitted to codify
for himself, in the latter. Mr Arnold was a little over thirty
when, collecting such things as he chose to collect out of his
earlier volumes of Poetry, and adding much to them, he
published the collection with a Preface in October 1853. I
doubt whether he ever wrote better, either in sense or in style;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>and I am quite sure that, while some of the defects of his
criticism, as it was to be, appear quite clearly in the paper, all
the pith and moment of that criticism appear in germ and
principle likewise.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Preface <i>of 1853</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the interesting and important “Advertisement” which,
eight months later, he prefixed to the second edition of this
book, Mr Arnold himself summed up the lessons of
the <cite>Preface</cite>, which followed it, under two main heads,—the
insistence on the importance of the subject—the “great
action”; and the further insistence on study of the ancients,
with the specified object of correcting the great vice of our
modern, and especially English, intellect—that it “is fantastic,
and wants sanity.” He thus, to some extent, justified the
erection of these into his two first and great commandments—the
table-headings, if not the full contents, of his creed and
law. But, for our purpose, we must analyse the Preface
itself rather more closely.</p>

<p class='c001'>It opens with an account of the reasons which led the
author to exclude <cite>Empedocles</cite>, not because the subject was
“a Sicilian Greek,” but from a consideration of the situation
itself. This he condemns in a passage which contains a very
great amount of critical truth, which is quite admirably expressed,
and which really adds one to the not extensive list
of critical axioms of the first class. Even here one may
venture to doubt whether the supreme poet will not
vindicate his omnipotence in treating <span lang="fr"><cite>poeticamente</cite></span>. But if
the sentence were so qualified as to warn the poet that
he will <em>hardly</em> succeed, it would be absolutely invulnerable
or impregnable.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Analysis of it,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But why, he asks, does he dwell on this unimportant and
private matter? Because he wishes particularly to disclaim
any deference to the objection referred to above as
to the choice of <em>ancient</em> subjects: to which he
might have added (as the careful reader of the whole piece
will soon perceive), because insistence on the character of
the Subject was his critical being’s very end and aim. In
effect, he uses both these battle-horses in his assault upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>the opposite doctrine that the poet must “leave the exhausted
past and fix his attention on the present.”<a id='r962'></a><a href='#f962' class='c010'><sup>[962]</sup></a> It is needless
to say that over his immediate antagonists he is completely
victorious. Whatever the origin of the ignoble and inept
fallacy concerned, this particular form of it was part of the
special mid-nineteenth century heresy of “progress.” But
whether he unhorses and “baffles” it in the right way may
be another question. <em>His</em> way is to dwell once more, and
with something already of the famous Arnoldian iteration,
on the paramount importance of the “action,” on the vanity
of the supposition that superior treatment will make up
for subjective inferiority. And he then exposes himself
dangerously by postulating the superior interest of “Achilles,
Prometheus, Clytemnestra, Dido,” to the personages of any
modern poem, and, perhaps still more dangerously, by
selecting as his modern poems <em>Hermann and Dorothea</em>, <em>Childe
Harold</em>, <em>Jocelyn</em> [!!!], and <em>The Excursion</em>. He may be said
here to lose a stirrup at least: but on the whole he certainly
establishes the point—too clear to need establishment—that
the <em>date</em> of an action signifies nothing. While if the further
statement that the action itself is all-important is disputable,
it is his doctrine and hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is consistent with this doctrine when he goes on to
argue that “the Greeks understood it far more clearly than
we do”—that “they regarded the whole, we the parts”—that,
while they kept the action uppermost, we prefer the expression.
Not that they neglected expression—“on the contrary,
they were ... the masters of the <em>grand style</em>.” Where
they did not indulge in this, where they were bald or trivial,
it was merely to let the majesty of the action stand forth
without a veil. “Their theory and practice alike, the admirable
treatise of Aristotle and the unrivalled works of their
poets, exclaim with a thousand tongues, ‘All depends upon
the subject. Choose a fitting action, penetrate yourself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>the feeling of its situations; this done, everything else will
follow.’”<a id='r963'></a><a href='#f963' class='c010'><sup>[963]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As a necessary consequence, they were “rigidly exacting”
as to construction: <em>we</em> believe in “the brilliant things that
arise under the poet’s pen as he goes along.” We refuse
to ask for a “total impression”: instead of requiring that
the poet shall as far as possible efface himself, we even lay
it down that “a true allegory of the state of one’s own mind
in a representative history is perhaps the highest thing one
can attempt in the way of poetry.” Against this Mr Arnold
pronounces <cite>Faust</cite>—though the work of “the greatest poet of
modern times, the greatest critic of all times”<a id='r964'></a><a href='#f964' class='c010'><sup>[964]</sup></a>—defective,
because it is something like this. Next he deplores the want
of a guide for a young writer, “a voice to prescribe to him
the aim he should keep in view”—and, in default of it,
insists once more on models.</p>

<p class='c001'>The foremost of these models for the English writer is, of
course, Shakespeare, of whom Mr Arnold speaks with becoming
reverence, and of whom he had earned the right to speak
by his magnificent sonnet years earlier. But his attitude
towards Shakespeare, as a literary Bible, is guarded. Shakespeare
chose subjects “than which the world could afford no
better”; but his expression was <em>too</em> good—too “eminent and
unrivalled,” too fixing and seductive to the attention, so
to draw it away from those other things which were “his
excellences <em>as a poet</em>.”<a id='r965'></a><a href='#f965' class='c010'><sup>[965]</sup></a> In leading writers to forget this,
Shakespeare has done positive harm, and Keats’s <cite>Pot of Basil</cite>
is taken as an instance, whence the critic diverges to a long
condemnation of this great but erring bard’s “difficulty” of
language, and returns to the doctrine that he is <cite>not</cite> safe as a
model. The ancients are: though even in them there is something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>narrow, something local and temporary. But there is
so much that is not, and that is an antidote to modern banes,
that we cannot too much cling to them as models. These, he
adds at some length, the present age needs morally as much
as artistically. He has himself tried, in the poems he is
issuing, to obey his own doctrines: and he ends with the
famous peroration imploring respect for Art, and pleading for
the observance and preservation of “the wholesome regulative
laws of Poetry,” lest they be “condemned and cancelled by
the influence of their eternal enemy, Caprice.”</p>

<a id='sec9.3.5'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>and interim summary of its gist.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Comment on this, beyond the remarks already made, had
best be postponed till we can consider Mr Arnold’s criticism
as a whole. <a id='sec9.3.6'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>Contrast with Dryden.</i></span>But to one thing we should draw
attention, and that is, that here is a critic who
knows what he means, and who means something
not, directly, or as a whole, meant, or at least said, by any
earlier critic. That “all depends on the subject” had been
said often enough before: but it had not been said by any
one who had the whole of literature before him, and the
tendency—for half a century distinctly, for a full century
more or less—had been to unsay or gainsay it. Further, the
critic has combined with the older Neo-classic adoration of
the “fable” something perhaps traceable, as hinted above, to
the Wordsworthian horror of poetic diction, a sort of cult of
baldness instead of beauty, and a distrust, if not horror, of
“expression.” In fact, though I do not believe that he in the
least knew it, he is taking up a position of direct and, as it
were, designed antagonism to Dryden’s, in that remarkable
preface to <cite>An Evening’s Love</cite>, one of those in which
he comes closest to the Spaniards, where he says
plumply “the story is the least part,” and declares
that the important part is the workmanship—that <em>this</em> is
the <em>poiesis</em>. It is hardly possible to state the “dependence”—in
the old duelling sense—of the great quarrel of Poetics, and
almost of Criticism, more clearly than is done in these two
<cite>Prefaces</cite> by these two great poet-critics of the seventeenth and
the nineteenth centuries in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not think that there is any published evidence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>time or of the circumstances at and in which Mr Arnold
began contributing critical articles to periodicals.
<a id='sec9.3.7'></a><span class='sni side12'><i>Chair-work at Oxford, and contributions to periodicals.</i></span> But
his appointment (which must have been, at
any rate to some extent, due to the <cite>Preface</cite> as well
as to the <cite>Poems</cite>) to the Professorship of Poetry at
Oxford in 1857 gave him a strong stimulus towards the
development of his critical powers in reasoned form; while
shortly afterwards, the remarkable developments of the press
towards the end of the ’Fifties, which began by the institution
of <cite>Macmillan’s</cite> and the <cite>Cornhill Magazine</cite>, and continued
through the establishment of a strongly literary and critical
daily newspaper in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, to the multiplication
of monthly reviews proper in the <cite>Fortnightly</cite>, <cite>Contemporary</cite>,
and <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, supplied him with opportunities of
communicating these studies to a public larger than his Oxford
audience, and with a profitable and convenient intermediate
stage between the lecture and the book. He was, however,
always rather scrupulous about permitting his utterances the
“third reading”: and some of them (notably his Inaugural
Address at Oxford) have still to be sought in the catacombs.
But the matter of more than a decade’s production, by which
he chose to stand, is included in the three well-known volumes,
<cite>On Translating Homer</cite> and <cite>The Study of Celtic Literature</cite> for
the Oxford Lectures, and the famous <cite>Essays in Criticism</cite> for
the more miscellaneous work, the last, however, being rounded
off and worked up into a whole by its Preface, and by its two
opening pieces, <cite>The Function of Criticism in the Present Time</cite>
and <cite>The Influence of Academies</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these three books the expression of critical attitude,
displayed, as we have said, unmistakably in the <cite>Preface</cite> of 1853,
is not only developed and varied into something as nearly
approaching to a <cite>Summa Criticismi</cite> as was in Mr Arnold’s not
excessively systematic way, but furnished and illustrated by
an extraordinarily interesting and sufficiently diversified body
of critical applications in particular. Yet there is no divergence
from the lines marked out in the Preface, nor is there to be
found any such divergence—if divergence imply the least
contradiction or inconsistency—in the work of the last decade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>of his life, when he had dropped his ill-omened guerilla against
dogma and miracles, and had returned to the Muses. He is
as much a typical example of a critic consistent in consistency
as Dryden is of one consistent in inconsistency: and it
naturally requires less intelligence to comprehend him than
appears to be the case in the other instance. In fact, he could
never be misunderstood in general: though his extreme wilfulness,
and his contempt of history, sometimes made him a
little bewildering to the plain man in detail.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>On Translating Homer.</div>

<p class='c001'>In discussing the first, and indeed all, of these, it is, of
course, important to keep what is suitable for a History of
Criticism apart from what would be suitable only
for a monograph on Mr Arnold. Yet the idiosyncrasies
of the greater critics are as much the subject
of such a general history as their more abstract doctrines. We
see, then, here something which was not difficult to discern,
even in the more frugal and guarded expression of the <cite>Preface</cite>,
and which, no doubt, is to some extent fostered and intensified
by that freedom from the check of immediate contradiction or
criticism which some have unkindly called the dangerous prerogative
of preachers and professors. This something is the
Arnoldian confidence—that quality which Mr Hutton, perhaps
rather kindly, took for “sureness,” and which, though
strangely different in tone, is not so very different in actual
nature from the other “sureness” (with a prefix) of Lord
Macaulay. We may think that this confidence is certainly
strengthened, and perhaps to some extent caused, by a habit
of turning the blind eye on subjects of which the critic does
not know very much, and inspecting very cursorily those which
he does not much like. But we shall see that, right or wrong,
partial or impartial, capricious or systematic as he may be, Mr
Arnold applies himself to the actual appreciation of actual
literature, and to the giving of reasons for his appreciation, in
a way new, delightful, invaluable.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>“<i>The grand style.</i>”</div>

<p class='c001'>The really important part or feature of the tractate for us
is its famous handling of “the Grand Style.” He
had used this phrase, italicising it, in the <cite>Preface</cite>
itself, had declared that the ancients were its “unapproached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>masters,” but he had not said much about it or attempted to
define it. Here he makes it almost his chief battle-charger—presenting
Homer, Dante, and Milton as the greatest masters
of it, if not the only sure ones, denying any <em>regular</em> possession
of it to Shakespeare, and going far to deny most other
poets, from Tennyson down to Young, the possession of it at
all. It was impossible that this enigmatic critical phrase,
applied so provocatively, should not itself draw the fire of
critics. He could not but reply to this in his “Last Words,”
but he had to make something of a confession and avoidance,
with much sorrow, perhaps not without a very little anger.
For those who asked “What <em>is</em> the Grand Style?” mockingly,
he had no answer: they were to “die in their sins.” To those
who asked with sincerity, he vouchsafed the answer that the
grand style “arises in poetry when a noble nature, poetically
gifted, treats with simplicity or severity a serious subject.”
Let us, with as much simplicity, severity, and seriousness as
may be, treat both the expression and the definition.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Discussion of it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The expression itself—the origin of which, like that of
some others in our special lexicon, is to be found in the
criticism not of literature, but of Art in the limited
sense, and which was, I think, first made current in
English by Sir Joshua Reynolds—is of course a vague one,
and we must walk warily among its associations and suggestions.
At one end it suggests, with advantage to itself
and to us honest inquirers, the ὕψος of Longinus. At the
other, it has perhaps a rather damaging suggestion of the
French <span lang="fr"><i>style noble</i></span>, and a still more dangerous echo-hint of
“grand<em>iose</em>.” And Mr Arnold himself once (<cite>Preface</cite>, ed. 1853,
p. xix) uses “grandiose”, as we saw that the Latins and
the French have sometimes done, as equivalent to “grand”.
Coming, then, unsatisfied by these vaguenesses, to the definition,
we shall perhaps think it permissible to strike out the first
two members, as in the former case almost self-confessedly, in
the second quite, superfluous. That the Grand Style in poetry
will only arise when the stylist is poetically gifted scarcely
requires even enunciation: that the nature which produces
the grand style must be <span lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>pro hac vice</i></span> “noble,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>is also sun-clear. Something of the Longinian circularity in
one point<a id='r966'></a><a href='#f966' class='c010'><sup>[966]</sup></a> seems to have infected Mr Arnold here. But with
the rest of the definition preliminary and <span lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span> inquiry
has no fault to find. Let us take it that the Grand Style
in poetry is the treatment of a serious subject with simplicity
or severity. Even to this a fresh demurrer arises, which may
be partly, but cannot be wholly, overruled. Why this antithesis,
this mutual exclusion, between “simplicity” and “severity”?
“Severe simplicity” is a common, and is generally
thought a just, phrase: at any rate, the two things are closely
related. We may note this only—adding in Mr Arnold’s
favour that his special attribution of simplicity to Homer and
severity to Milton would seem to indicate that by the latter
word he means “gorgeousness <em>severely restrained</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This, with such additional and applied lights as are provided
by Mr Arnold’s denunciation of <em>affectation</em> as fatal to the
Grand Style, will give us some idea of what he wished to mean
by the phrase. It is, in fact, a fresh formulation of the Classical
restraint, definiteness, proportion, form, against the Romantic
vague, the Romantic fantasy. This had been the lesson of
the Preface, given after the preceptist manner. It is now the
applied, illustrated, appreciative lesson of the <cite>Lectures</cite>. It is
a doctrine like another: and, in its special form and plan,
an easily comprehensible reaction from a reaction—in fact,
the inevitable ebb after the equally inevitable flow. But when
we begin to examine it (especially in comparison with its
Longinian original) as a matter of theory, and with its own
illustrations as a matter of practice, doubts and difficulties
come thick upon us, and we may even feel under a sad
necessity of “dying in our sins,” just as Mr Carlyle thought
that, at a certain period of his career, Ignatius Loyola “ought
to have made up his mind to be damned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To take the last first, it is difficult, on examining Mr
Arnold’s instances and his comments, in the most impartial
and judicial manner possible, to resist the conclusion that
his definition only really fits Dante, and that it was originally
derived from the study of him. To that fixed star of first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>magnitude in poetry it <em>does</em> apply as true, as nothing but
true, and perhaps even as the whole truth. Nobility, quintessential
poetry, simplicity in at least some senses, severity
and seriousness in almost all,—who will deny these things to
the <cite>Commedia</cite>? But it is very difficult to think that it applies,
in anything like the same coequal and coextensive fashion, to
either Homer or Milton. There are points in which Homer
touches Dante; there are points in which Dante touches
Milton; but they are not the same points. It may, further,
be very much doubted whether Mr Arnold has not greatly
exaggerated both Homer’s universal “simplicity” and his
universal “seriousness.” The ancients were certainly against
him on the latter point. While one may feel not so much
doubt as certainty that the application of “severity” to Milton—unless
it means simply the absence of geniality and humour—is
still more rash.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when we look back to Longinus we shall find at least
a hint of a much more serious defect than this. Why this
unnecessary asceticism and grudging in the connotation of
grandeur? why this tell-tale and self-accusing limitation
further to a bare three poets, two of them, indeed, of the very
greatest? Mr Arnold himself feels the difficulty presented by
Shakespeare so strongly that he has to make, as it were,
uncovenanted grand-style mercies for him. But that is only
because you have simply to open almost any two pages out of
three in Shakespeare, and the grand style smites you in the face,
as God’s glory smote St Stephen. <em>We</em> can afford, which shows
our strength, to leave Shakespeare alone. Longinus of old has
no such damaging fencing of the table of <em>his</em> Grand Style. The
Greeks, it is known, thought little of Love as a subject: yet he
admitted the sublimity of Sappho. And if he objected to the
πλεκτάνην χειμάρροον of Æschylus, it was only because he
thought it went too far. How much wiser is it, instead of
fixing such arbitrary limits, to recognise that the Grand Style
has infinite manifestations; that it may be found in poets who
have it seldom as well as in those who have it often; that
Herrick has it with</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>that Tennyson has it again and again; that Goethe has it in
the final octet of <cite>Faust</cite>; that Heine and Hugo, and hundreds
of others, down to quite minor poets in their one moment of
rapturous union with the Muse, have it. How much wiser to
recognise further that it is not limited to the simple or severe:
whether it is to the serious is another question. For my
part, I will not loose the fragile boat or incur the danger of the
roof,—speaking in a Pickwickian-Horatian manner,—with any
one who denies the grand style to Donne or to Dryden, to
Spenser or to Shelley. The grand is the transcendent: and it
is blasphemy against the Spirit of Poetry to limit the fashions
and the conditions of transcendence.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Study of Celtic Literature.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The other “chair”-book, <cite>The Study of Celtic Literature</cite>, is
tempting in promise, but disappointing in performance. This
is due partly to the fact that great—perhaps the
greater—part of it is not occupied with literary
criticism at all, but with that curious blend of
matter—literary, political, theological, ethical, and social—to
the manufacture of which Mr Arnold was more and more
turning his attention. And when it becomes literary, we find
other difficulties. In the <cite>Preface</cite> itself, and in the <cite>Homer</cite>,
Mr Arnold had sometimes been unjust or unsatisfactory on
what he did not know or did not like—Mediæval literature,
the Ballad, &#38;c.,—but his remarks and his theories had been,
in the main, solidly based upon what he did know thoroughly
and did appreciate—the Classics, Dante, Milton, Wordsworth.
Here not Pallas, I think, but some anti-Pallas, has “invented
a new thing.” Whether Mr Arnold knew directly, and at first-hand,
<em>any</em> Welsh, Breton, Cornish, Irish, or Scotch Gaelic, I
do not know.<a id='r967'></a><a href='#f967' class='c010'><sup>[967]</sup></a> He certainly disclaims anything like extensive
or accurate knowledge, and it is noticeable that (I think invariably)
he quotes from translations, and only a few well-known
translations. Moreover he, with his usual dislike and distrust
of the historic method, fences with, or puts off, the inquiry
what the dates of the <em>actual</em> specimens which we possess of
this literature may be. Yet he proceeds to pick out (as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>directly acquainted with the literatures themselves, at dates
which make the matter certain) divers characteristics of “melancholy,”
“natural magic,” &#38;c., in Celtic literature, and then,
unhesitatingly and without proof of any kind, to assign the
presence of these qualities, in writers like Shakespeare and
Keats, where we have not the faintest evidence of Celtic <em>blood</em>,
to “Celtic” influence.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its assumptions.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Now, we may or may not deplore this proceeding; but we
must disallow it. It is both curious and instructive that
the neglect of history which accompanied the prevalence
of Neo-classicism, and with which, when it
was dispelled, Neo-classicism itself faded, should reappear in
company with this <em>neotato</em>-classicism, this attempt to reconstruct
the classic faith, taking in something, but a carefully
limited something, of Romanticism. But the fact is certain:
and, as has been said, we must disallow the proceeding.
Whether melancholy, and natural magic, and the vague do
strongly and especially, if not exclusively, appear in Celtic
poetry, I do not deny, because I do not know; that Mr Arnold’s
evidence is not sufficient to establish their special if not exclusive
prevalence, I deny, because I do know. That there is
melancholy, natural magic, the vague in Shakespeare and in
Keats, I admit, because I know; that Mr Arnold has any
valid argument showing that their presence is due to Celtic
influence, I do not admit, because I know that he has produced
none. With bricks of ignorance and mortar of assumption
you can build no critical house.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Essays: <i>their case for Criticism</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In that central citadel or canon of the subject, <cite>Essays in
Criticism</cite>, this contraband element, this theory divorced from
history, makes its appearance but too often: it can
and need only be said, for instance, that Mr Arnold’s
estimate of the condition of French, and still
more of German, literature in his own day, as compared
with English, will not stand for five minutes the examination
of any impartial judge, dates and books in hand.
But the divorce is by no means so prominent—indeed most
of the constituent essays were, if I mistake not, written
before the Celtic Lectures were delivered. The book is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>much the best known of Mr Arnold’s critical works—except
perhaps the Preface to Mr Ward’s <cite>Poets</cite>—that no elaborate
analysis of it here can be necessary. Its own Preface is defiantly
vivacious—and Vivacity, as we are often reminded, is
apt to play her sober friend Criticism something like the
tricks that Madge Wildfire played to Jeanie Deans. But it
contains, in the very last words of its famous epiphonema to
Oxford, an admission (in the phrase “this Queen of Romance”)
that Mr Arnold was anything but a classic <span lang="fr"><i>pur sang</i></span>. The
two first Essays, “The Function of Criticism at the Present
Time” and the “Influence of Academies,” take up, both in the
vivacious and in the sober manner, the main line and strategy
of the old <cite>Preface</cite> itself. We may, not merely with generosity
but with justice, “write off” the, as has been said,
historically false parallels with France and Germany which
the writer brings in to support his case. That case itself is
perfectly solid and admissible. Those who are qualified to
judge—not perhaps a large number—will admit, whether
they are for it or against it, that no nonsuit is possible,
and perhaps that no final decision for it or against is possible
either, except to the satisfaction of mere individual taste and
opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case is, that the remedy for the supposed or supposable
deficiencies of English literature is Criticism—that the
business of Criticism is to discover the ideas upon which creative
literature must rest—that there is not enough “play of
mind” in England—that Criticism again is the attempt “to
know the best that is known and thought in the world”—that
foreign literature is specially valuable, simply because it is
likely to give that in which native literature is lacking.
These are the doctrines of the First Essay, mingled with much
political-social application and not a little banter. The second
takes them up and applies them afresh in the direction of
extolling the institution of Academies, and contrasting the
effects of that influence on French critics and the absence of
it in English, very much to the disadvantage of the latter,
especially Mr Palgrave. For Mr Arnold had adopted early
in his professorial career, and never gave up, the very dubious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>habit of enforcing his doctrine with “uses” of formally polite
but extremely personal application.<a id='r968'></a><a href='#f968' class='c010'><sup>[968]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Now, this case or bundle of cases is, I have said, quite fairly
and justly arguable. Even though I hope that great part
of this volume and of the last will have shown that Mr Arnold
was quite wrong as to the general inferiority of English
criticism, he was (as I have, not far back, taken the pains to
show also) not quite wrong about the general criticism of his
own youth and early manhood—of the criticism which he himself
came to reform. Nor was he wrong in thinking that there
is in the uncultivated and unregenerate English mind a sort
of rebelliousness to sound critical principles. Very much of
his main contention is perfectly good and sound: nor could
he have urged any two things more universally and everlastingly
profitable than the charge never to neglect criticism,
and the charge always to compare literatures of other countries,
literatures of other times, literatures free from the political-religious-social
<span lang="la"><i>diathesis</i></span> of the actual patient.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.14'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Their examples thereof.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is generally acknowledged that the influence of Sainte-Beuve
was an “infortune of Mart” or of Saturn, when  it
induced Mr Arnold to take his two first examples
of this comparative study from interesting but unimportant
people like the Guérins. But except
persons determined to cavil, and those of whom the Judicious
Poet remarks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For what was there each cared no jot,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all were wroth with what was not”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>every one will admit that the rest of the seven—the “Heine,”
the “Pagan and Mediæval Religious Sentiment,” the “Joubert,”
the “Spinoza,” and the “M. Aurelius”—form a pentad of critical
excellence, and brilliancy, and instruction, which can nowhere
be exceeded. I, at least, should find it hard to match the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>group in any other single volume of criticism. Idle that we
may frequently smile or shake the head—that we must in some
cases politely but peremptorily deny individual propositions!
Unimportant that, perhaps even more by a certain natural
perversity than by the usual and most uncritical tendency to
depress something in order to exalt something else, English
literature is, with special reference to the great generation of
1798-1834, unduly depreciated! These things every man can
correct for himself. How many could make for themselves
instances of comparative, appreciative, loosely but subtly judicial
criticism as attractive, as stimulating, as graceful, as varied,
and critically as excellent, being at the same time real examples
of creative literature?</p>

<a id='sec9.3.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The latest work.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We are fortunately dispensed here from inquiring into the
causes, or judging the results, of that avocation from literature,
or at least literary criticism, which held Mr Arnold
for exactly ten years, from 1867 to 1877. Nor
will it be necessary (though it would be pleasant) to discuss
in detail all the contributions of the slightly longer period
which was left him, from his return to his proper task in the
spring of 1877 with the article on M. Scherer’s “Milton,” to
his sudden and lamented death in the spring of 1888. Just
before that death he had published an article on Shelley,
which (for all the heresy glanced at below) is one of the very
best things he ever did; little less can be said of the Milton-Scherer
paper eleven years earlier, and whenever he touched
literature (which was fairly often) during the interval, he was
almost always at a very high level. A good deal, though not
quite all, of the ebullience of something not quite unlike
flippancy, which had characterised his middle period, had
frothed and bubbled itself away; his general critical views
had matured without altering; and their application to fresh
subjects, if it sometimes (as very notably in the case of Shelley)
brought out their weakness, brought out much more fully
their value and charm. The article on Mr Stopford Brooke’s
<cite>Primer of English Literature</cite>, the prefaces to the selected Lives
of Johnson, to Wordsworth, to Byron, the papers in Mr Ward’s
<cite>Poets</cite> on Gray and Keats (postponing for a moment the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>important Introduction to that work as a whole), the literary
part of the <cite>Discourses in America</cite>, and (though I should put this
last quartette on a somewhat lower level) those on Mr
Scherer’s Goethe, George Sand, Tolstoi, and Amiel, form a
critical baggage, adding no doubt nothing (except in one case)
to the critic’s general Gospel or theory, but exemplifying
with delightful variety and charm his critical practice.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Introduction to Ward’s</i> English Poets.</div>

<p class='c001'>The possible or actual exception, however, and the piece
which contains it, require more individual notice.  In the
Introduction to Mr Ward’s book, Mr Arnold devised
no one really new thing, but he gathered up and
focussed his lights afresh, and endeavoured to
provide his disciples with an apparently new
definition of poetry. He drove first at two wrong estimates
thereof, his dislike of the second of which—the “personal”
estimate—had been practically proclaimed from the very first,
and may be allowed to be to a great extent justified, while
his dislike of the first—the “historic” estimate—had always
been clear to sharp-eyed students, though it lacked an equal
justification. In fact, it is little more than a formulation of
Mr Arnold’s own impatience with the task—laborious enough,
no doubt, and in parts ungrateful—of really mastering poetic,
that is to say literary, history. Of course, <em>mere</em> age, <em>mere</em>
priority, confers no interest of itself on anything. But to say—if
we may avail ourselves of Gascoigne’s instance—that the
first discoverable person who compared a girl’s lip to a cherry
does not acquire for that now unpermissible comparison merit
and interest, is not wise. To assume, on the other hand,
some abstract standard of “high” poetry, below which time
and relation will not give or enhance value, is still less wise.
Portia, in a context of which Mr Arnold was justly fond, might
have taught him that “nothing is good <em>without respect</em>,” and
that <em>no</em> “respect” is to be arbitrarily barred.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>“<cite>Criticism of Life.</cite>”</div>

<p class='c001'>But even from the sweetest and wisest of doctors he would
not, I fear, have taken the lesson.  He is set to prove that
we must only  pay  attention to “the best and
principal things” as of old,—to class and mark these
jealously, and to endeavour to discover their qualification.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>You must not praise the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chanson de Roland</cite></span> or any early
French poetry very highly, but you may praise (as before)
Homer, Milton, and Dante as much as you like. Chaucer,
like Burns, Dryden, and Pope, like Shelley, has not “high
seriousness.” And poetry is expressly defined as “a criticism
of life, under the conditions fixed for such a criticism by the
laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is important (though very difficult) to keep undue repetition
out of such a book as this, and we shall therefore, in regard
to “high seriousness,” merely refer the reader to what has
been said above on the “grand style.” And we shall cut down
criticism of the definition as much as possible, to return to it
presently. The defence of it once made, as “not a definition
but an epigram,” certainly lacks seriousness, whether high or
low. The severest strictures made on Mr Arnold’s levity
would not have been misplaced had he offered an epigram
here. Nor need we dwell on the perhaps inevitable, but
certainly undeniable, “circularity” of the formula. The
<span lang="la"><i>jugulum</i></span> at which to aim is the use of the word “criticism”
<em>at all</em>. Either the word is employed in some private jargon, or it
has no business here. Mr Arnold’s own gloss of the “application
of ideas to life,” gives it perhaps the doubtful benefit of
the first supposition: but, either in this way or in others,
does it very little good. <em>All</em> literature is the application of
ideas to life: and to say that poetry is the application of
ideas to life, under the conditions fixed for poetry, is simply
a vain repetition.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Poetic Subject or Poetic Moment.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Yet insufficient, and to some moods almost <span lang="fr"><i>saugrenu</i></span>, as
such a definition may seem at first sight, it is, calmly and
critically considered, only a re-forming of the old
line of battle. Once more, and for the last time
formally, Mr Arnold is taking the field in favour of
the doctrine of the Poetic <em>Subject</em>, as against what we may,
perhaps, make a shift to call the “Doctrine of the Poetic
<em>Moment</em>.” It is somewhat surprising that, although this antinomy
has been visible throughout the whole long chain of
documents which I have been endeavouring to exhibit in order,
no one, so far as I know, has ever fully brought it out, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>least on the one side. Mr Arnold—like all who agree with
him, and all with whom he and they agree, or would have
agreed, from Aristotle downwards—demands a subject of distinct
and considerable magnitude, a disposition of no small
elaborateness, a maintained and intense attitude, which is variously
adumbrated by a large number of terms, down to “grand
style” and “high seriousness.” The others, who have fought
(we must confess most irregularly and confusedly as a rule)
under the flag which Patrizzi, himself half or wholly unknowing,
was the first to fly, go back, or forward, or aside to the
<em>Poetic Moment</em>—to the sudden transcendence and transfiguration—by
“treating poetically,” that is to say, by passionate interpretation,
in articulate music—of <em>any</em> idea or image, <em>any</em> sensation or
sentiment. They are perfectly ready to admit that he who has
these moments most constantly and regularly under his command—he
who can co-ordinate and arrange them most skilfully
and most pleasingly—is the greatest poet, and that, on the other
hand, one or two moments of poetry will hardly make a poet
of any but infinitesimal and atomic greatness. But this is the
difference of the poets, not of the poetry. Shakespeare is an
infinitely great poet, and Langhorne an infinitesimally small
one. Yet when Langhorne writes</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>he has in the italicised line a “poetic moment” which is, for its
poetic quality, as free of the poetic Jerusalem as “We are such
stuff,” or the dying words of Cleopatra. He has hit “what it
was so easy to miss,” the passionate expression, in articulate
music, unhit before, never to be poetically hit again save by
accident, yet never to perish from the world of poetry. It is
only a grain of gold (“fish-scale” gold, even, as the mining experts
call their nearly impalpable specks), but it is gold: something
that you can never degrade to silver, or copper, or
pinchbeck.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>To Mr Arnold this doctrine of the Poetic Moment, though he
never seems to have quite realised it in its naked enormity
(which, indeed, as I have said, has seldom been frankly, as here,
unveiled), was from the first the Enemy. He attacked it, as we
saw in his <cite>Preface</cite>, when he was young, and he fashions this
<cite>Introduction</cite> so as to guard against it in his age. Yet it is
curious that in his practice he sometimes goes perilously near
to it. On his own showing, I cannot quite see, though I can
see it perfectly well on mine, why even such a magnificent
line as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<p class='c009'>should not only prove Dante’s supremacy, but serve as an
infallible touchstone for detecting the presence or absence of
high poetic quality in other poetry. High poetic quality
depends, we have been told, on the selection and arrangement
of the subject. Dante, we know accidentally and from outside,
<em>has</em> that selection and arrangement. But suppose he had not?
The line itself can tell us nothing about them.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Arnold’s accomplishment and position as a critic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, as has been said so often, the side which a man
may have taken in the everlasting and irreconcilable critical
battle of judges by the arrangement, and judges by
the result, hardly affects his place in Criticism as it
should be allotted by a final Court of Appeal. How
does he express for himself, and how does he promote in
others, the intelligent appreciation, the conscious enjoyment of
literature? That is the question: and few critics can meet this
question more triumphantly than Mr Arnold. Like others, he
can but give what he has. If you ask him for a clear, complete,
resumed, and reasoned grasp of a man’s accomplishment—for
a definite placing of him in the literary atlas—he will not
have much answer to give you. He does not pretend, and has
never pretended, to give any. A certain want of logical and
methodical aptitude, which may be suspected, a dislike of
reading matter that did not interest him, which is pretty clear,
and that dread and distrust of the “historic estimate,” which
he openly proclaimed, would have made this impossible. But
we were warned at the very outset not to go to him for it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>And for acute, sensitive, inspired, and inspiring <em>remarks</em> on the
man, or the work, or this and that part of work and man—attractively
expressed, ingeniously co-ordinated, and redeemed
from mere desultoriness by the constant presence of the general
critical creed—no critic is his superior.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor are these his only “proofs”—his only “pieces in hand.”
He may be said—imperfectly Romantic, or even anti-Romantic,
as he was—to have been the very first critic to urge the
importance, the necessity, of that comparative criticism of
different literatures, the half-blind working of which had
helped to create, if it had not actually created, the Romantic
movement. In England he was absolutely the first to do this
systematically, and with something like—though not with
complete—impartiality. The knowledge of Spanish and Italian
poetry and romance, long very common with us, had died down
in the first half of the nineteenth century, and had not been
much used for critical purposes while it lasted. The <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span>
for French, of the late seventeenth and eighteenth, had
reacted itself—in men as different as Coleridge, Landor, and De
Quincey—into a depreciation which, if not “violently absurd,”
as Mr Arnold translates Rémusat’s term of <span lang="fr"><i>saugrenu</i></span> applied
to it, was certainly either crassly ignorant or violently unjust.
German had, it is true, been exalted on the ruins of the popularity
of the three Romance literatures; but it had been worshipped
scarcely according to knowledge: and of the whole
mediæval literature of Europe there was hardly any general
critical appreciation. Mr Arnold himself, in fact, was still
too much in the gall of bitterness here. It was imperative, if
the Romantic and “result-judging” criticism was not to become
a mere wilderness of ill-founded and partial individualisms,
that this comparison should be established. It was equally
imperative that it should be established, if Mr Arnold’s own
“<i>neotato</i>-classicism,” as we have called it, was not to wizen and
ossify like Neo-classicism itself. He was its first preacher with
us: and there had not, to my knowledge, been any such definite
preacher of it abroad, though the practice of Germany had implied
and justified it from the first. And he was one of its
most accomplished practitioners,—Lessing not being equal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>him in charm, and Sainte-Beuve a little his inferior in passion
for the best things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet another watch-word of his, sovereign for the time and
new in most countries, which he constantly repeated (if, being
human, he did not always fully observe it himself), was the
caution against confounding literary and non-literary judgment.
No one rejected the exaggeration of “Art for Art’s sake <em>only</em>”
more unhesitatingly; but no one oftener repeated the caution
against letting the idols of the nation, the sect, the party interfere
with the free play of Art herself, and of critical judgment
on Art.</p>

<p class='c001'>His services, therefore, to English Criticism, whether as a
“preceptist” or as an actual craftsman, cannot possibly be
overestimated. In the first respect he was, if not the absolute
reformer,—these things, and all things, reform themselves under
the guidance of the Gods and the Destinies, not of men,—the
leader in reform, of the slovenly and disorganised condition into
which Romantic criticism had fallen. In the second, the things
which he had not, as well as those which he had, combined to
give him a place among the very first. He had not the sublime
and ever new-inspired inconsistency of Dryden. Dryden,
in Mr Arnold’s place, might have begun by cursing Shelley a
little, but would have ended by blessing him all but wholly.
He had not the robustness of Johnson; the supreme critical
“reason” (as against understanding) of Coleridge; scarcely the
exquisite, if fitful, appreciation of Lamb, or the full-blooded and
passionate appreciation of Hazlitt. But he had an exacter
knowledge than Dryden’s; the fineness of his judgment shows
finer beside Johnson’s bluntness; he could not wool-gather like
Coleridge; his range was far wider than Lamb’s; his scholarship
and his delicacy alike give him an advantage over Hazlitt.
Systematic without being hidebound; well-read (if not exactly
learned) without pedantry; delicate and subtle, without weakness
or dilettanteism; catholic without eclecticism; enthusiastic
without indiscriminateness,—Mr Arnold is one of the best and
most precious of teachers on his own side. And when, at those
moments which are, but should not be, rare, the Goddess of
Criticism descends, like Cambina and her lion-team, into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>lists, and with her Nepenthe makes men forget sides and sects
in a common love of literature, then he is one of the best and
most precious of critics.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr Arnold’s criticism continued to be fresh and lively,
without a touch of senility, or of failure to adapt itself to new
conditions, till the day of his death: and when that evil day
came, the nineteenth century had little more than a decade to
run. On the other hand, though almost all his juniors were
more or less affected by him, it cannot be exactly said that
he founded any definite school, or started any by reaction from
himself. The most remarkable approach to such a school that
has been made since was made by Mr Pater, quite fifteen years
before Mr Arnold died. No very special necessities of method,
therefore, impose themselves upon us in regard to the classification
of our remaining subjects in the English division: and
we shall be safe in adopting a rough chronological order,
taking first three very remarkable persons who—though contemporaries
of Arnold—show in criticism as in other literature
the influence of Carlyle.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.20'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Carlylians.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The increasing disinclination to take the standpoint of pure
literary criticism which we noticed in the master, and which
characterised the second quarter of the century,
naturally and inevitably reproduced itself in the
three most brilliant of his disciples—Ruskin, Froude, and Kingsley—with
interesting variants and developments according to
the idiosyncrasy of the individual. There was, indeed, in them
something which can hardly be said to have been in Carlyle
at all—a weakness which his internal fire burnt out of him.
This weakness, formulated most happily by an erratic person
of genius whom I have alternately resolved to admit and decided
to exclude here—Thomas Love Peacock,—is the principle that
you “must take pleasure in the thing represented, before you
can derive any from the representation.”<a id='r970'></a><a href='#f970' class='c010'><sup>[970]</sup></a> Incidentally and
indirectly, no doubt, <span lang="la"><i>omnes eodem cogimur</i></span>; or at least there
are very few who escape the suck of the whirlpool. But the
declaration and formal acceptance of the principle is comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>modern: and it is one of the worst inheritances of that
Patristic attitude which we dwelt upon long ago.<a id='r971'></a><a href='#f971' class='c010'><sup>[971]</sup></a> It is indeed
closely connected with the doctrine that “all depends upon the
subject”: but the Greeks were too deeply penetrated with
æsthetic feeling to admit it openly, and, from the earliest times,
philosophised on the attraction of <em>repulsive</em> subjects. It is
indirectly excluded, likewise, by the stricter kinds of Neo-classic
rule-criticism, which saw nothing to disapprove in such poems
as the <cite>Syphilis</cite>. But it has, like other dubious spirits,
been let loose by “the Anarchy.” That you may and should
“like what you like” is open to the twist of its correlative—that
you may <em>dis</em>like what <em>you choose to</em> dislike.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Kingsley.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, all these three distinguished persons showed
the Carlylian-Peacockian will-worship in their different ways,
to an extent which makes them, as critics, little
more than extremely interesting curiosities. Kingsley,
the least strong, intellectually speaking, of the three,
shows it strongly enough. His saying (reported, I think, by
the late Mr Kegan Paul), when one of his children asked who
and what was Heine, “A bad man, my dear, a bad man,” is a
specially interesting blend of the doctrine formulated by
Peacock with the old Platonic-Patristic “the poet-is-a-<em>good
man</em>” theory. Heine was not quite “a proper moral man” in
his early years, certainly: though one might have thought that
those later ones in the <span lang="de"><cite>Matraszen-Gruft</cite></span> would have atoned in
the eyes of the sternest inquisitor. But “bad” would have
been a harsh term for him at any time. Still, it emphasises
the speaker’s inability to distinguish between morality and
genius, between the man and the work. This inability was
pretty universal with him, and it makes Kingsley’s own work
as criticism almost wholly untrustworthy, though often very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>interesting and stimulating to readers who have the proper
correctives and antidotes ready: it even (which is not so very
common a thing) affects his praise nearly as much as his blame.
You must be on your guard against it, when he extols <cite>Euphues</cite>
and the <cite>Fool of Quality</cite><a id='r972'></a><a href='#f972' class='c010'><sup>[972]</sup></a> as much as when he depreciates Shelley.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.22'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Froude.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There was less sentimental and ethical prejudice in Mr
Froude than in his brother-in-law, but his political and, in a
wide, not to say loose, sense philosophical, prejudices
were even stronger, and he drew nearer to Carlyle
than did either Kingsley or Ruskin in a certain want of <em>interest</em>
in literature as literature.<a id='r973'></a><a href='#f973' class='c010'><sup>[973]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.3.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Mr Ruskin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We reach, however, as every one will have anticipated, the
furthest point of our “eccentric” in Mr Ruskin. His waywardness
is indeed a point which needs no labouring,
but it is never displayed more incalculably to
the unwary, more calculably to those who have the clue in
their hands, than in reference to his literary judgments. Injustice
would be done to Rapin and Rymer if we did not
give some of the enormous paradoxes and paralogisms to which
he has committed himself in this way: but the very abundance
of them is daunting, and fortunately his work is not so far from
the hands of probable readers as the dustbin-catacombs where
those poor old dead lie. “Indignation is a poetical feeling if
excited by serious injury, but not if entertained on being
cheated out of a small sum of money.” You may admire the
budding of a flower, but not a display of fireworks. Contrast
the famous exposure of the “pathetic fallacy” with Scott’s
supposed freedom from it, and you will find some of the most
exquisite <em>un</em>reasons in literature. The foam in Kingsley’s song
must not be “cruel,” but the Greta may be “happy,” simply
because Ruskin does not mind finding fault with Kingsley,
but has sworn to find no fault with Scott—perhaps also
because he, very justly, likes sea-foam. Squire Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>is not “a character,” because Ruskin had determined that
only persons “without a <em>fimetic</em> taint” can create character,
and Fielding had a fimetic taint. And dramatic poetry “despises
external circumstance” because Scott did <em>not</em> despise
external circumstance, and explanation is wanted why he could
not write a play. Whether, with the most delicious absurdity,
he works out a parallel between a “fictile” Greek vase (which
is also, one hears, “of the Madonna”) and “fiction,” or is very
nearly going to worship a locomotive when it makes a nasty
noise and convinces him of its diabolism, this same exquisite
unreason is always at the helm. It very often, generally
indeed, is committed in admiration of the right things; it is
always delightful literature itself. But it never has the

<a id='sec9.3.24'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>G. H. Lewes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That George Henry Lewes had many of the qualities of
the critic it would be mere foolish paradox to deny. His
<cite>Goethe</cite> and his <i>History</i> (if not) <i>of Philosophy</i> yet
“of Philosophers” are sufficient proofs for any
one to put in: and of his mastery of that element of
criticism which goes to the making of an <span lang="la"><i>impresario</i></span> the
wonderful success with which he formed and trained his
companion, George Eliot, is a still more convincing demonstration.
<a id='sec9.3.25'></a><span class='sni side7'><em>His</em> Principles of Success in Literature.</span>
I understand, also, that he had real merits as a
dramatic critic. But his chief critical work, <cite>The
Principles of Success in Literature</cite>,<a id='r975'></a><a href='#f975' class='c010'><sup>[975]</sup></a> betrays by its
very title the presence of an element of <em>vulgarity</em> in
him, which can indeed scarcely escape notice in
other parts of his work, and which is by no means removed
or neutralised by the quasi-philosophic tone of the work itself.
Much may be forgiven to a man, born in the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, when he uses the words “progress,”
“success,” and the like: but not everything. Fame may be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>last infirmity of noble minds; Success is but the first and last
morbid appetite of the vulgar. And, as has been said, Lewes
does not fully redeem his title by his text. There is plenty
of common-sense and shrewdness. There is plenty of apparent
and some real philosophy. Some, no doubt, will delight to
be told that there are three Laws of Literature, that “the
intellectual form is the Principle of Vision; the moral form
the Principle of Sincerity; and the æsthetic form the Principle
of Beauty,” and then to have these various eggs tossed and
caught, in deft arrangements, for some chapters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, there be many truths in the book, and I would most
carefully guard against the idea that Lewes knowingly and
deliberately recommends a mere tradesman-like view of
literature. On the contrary, he strongly protests against
it: and writes about Sincerity with every appearance of being
sincere.<a id='r976'></a><a href='#f976' class='c010'><sup>[976]</sup></a> But his view of Imagination is confessedly low, and
almost returns to the Addisonian standpoint of “ideas furnished
by sight.” And when, with a rather rash hiatus, he promises<a id='r977'></a><a href='#f977' class='c010'><sup>[977]</sup></a>
“<em>for the first time</em> to expound scientifically the Laws that constitute
the Philosophy of Criticism,” we listen even less hopefully
and even more doubtfully than somebody did when he
understood somebody else to say that he had killed the Devil.
Lewes is not unsound on the subject of imitation of the
classics. He has learnt from Coleridge, or from Wordsworth,
or from De Quincey, that style is the <em>body</em> not the <em>dress</em> of
thought: and much that he says about it is extremely shrewd
and true. But when he comes to its actual Laws and gives
them as Economy, Simplicity, Sequence, Climax, and Variety,
the old not at all divine despair comes upon us. All these
are well, but they are not Style’s crown; they are only and
hardly some of the balls and strawberry leaves of that crown.
A sentence, or a paragraph, or a page may be economic, simple,
sequacious, climacteric, and various, and not be good style. I
am not sure that a great piece of style might not be produced
to which, except by violence, no one of these epithets—I am
sure that many such pieces could be produced to which not
all—will apply. Once more the light and holy soul of literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>has wings to fly at suspicion of these bonds—and uses
them.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.26'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His</i> Inner Life of Art.</div>

<p class='c001'>Lewes’s best critical work by far<a id='r978'></a><a href='#f978' class='c010'><sup>[978]</sup></a> is to be found in the
Essay on <cite>The Inner Life of Art</cite>, where he handles, without
ceremony and with crushing force, the strange old
and new prudery about the connection of verse and
poetry, declaring plumply that the one is the form of the other.
But it is noticeable that this Essay is in the main merely a
catena or chrestomathy of critical extracts, united by some
useful review-work. On the whole, even after dismissing or
allowing for any undue “nervous impression” created by the
unlucky word “Success,” it is not very possible to give him,
as a critic, a position much higher than one corresponding to
the position of Helps. Lewes is a Helps much unconventionalised
and cosmopolitanised, not merely in externals. He
is not only much more skilled in philosophical terminology,
but he really knows more of what philosophy means. He has
more, much more, care for literature. But the stamp of the
Exhibition of 1851 is upon him also: and it is not for nothing
that his favourite and most unreservedly praised models of
style are drawn from Macaulay. I have no contempt for
Macaulay’s style myself: I have ventured in more places
than one or two to stigmatise such contempt as entirely uncritical.
But the <em>preference</em> of this style tells us much in this
context, as the <em>preference</em> of champagne in another.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.27'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Bagehot.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The evils of dissipation of energy have been lamented by
the grave and precise in all ages: and some have held that
they are specially discoverable in the most modern
times. It is very probable that Criticism may
charge to this account the comparatively faint and scanty
service done her by one who displayed so much faculty for
that service as Walter Bagehot. A man whose vocations and
avocations extend (as he himself says in a letter quoted by
Mr Hutton) from hunting to banking, and from arranging
Christmas festivities to editing the <cite>Economist</cite>, can have but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>odd moments for literature. Yet this man’s odd moments
were far from unprofitable. His essay on <cite>Pure, Ornate, and
Grotesque Art in Poetry</cite> would deserve a place even in a not
voluminous collection of the best and most notable of its kind.
The title, of course, indicates Wordsworth, Tennyson, and
Browning: and the paper itself may be said to have been one
of the earliest frankly to estate and recognise Tennyson—the
earliest of importance perhaps to estate and recognise Browning—among
the leaders of mid-nineteenth century poetry. As
such titles are wont to do, it somewhat overreaches itself, and
certainly implies or suggests a confusion as to the meaning of
“pure.” If pure is to mean “unadorned,” Wordsworth is
most certainly not at his poetical best when he has most of
the quality, but generally at his worst; if it means “sheer,”
“intense,” “quintessential,” his best of poetry has certainly no
more of it than the best of either of the other two. The
classification suggests, and the text confirms, a certain “popularity”
in Bagehot’s criticism. But it is popular criticism of
the very best kind, and certainly not to be despised because
it has something of mid-nineteenth century, and Macaulayan,
materialism and lack of subtlety. This <span lang="de"><i>derbheit</i></span> sometimes
led him wrong, as in that very estimate of Gibbon which
the same Mr Hutton praises, but oftener it contributed sense
and sanity to his criticism. And there are not many better
things in criticism than sanity and sense, especially when, as
in Bagehot’s case, they are combined with humour and with
good-humour.<a id='r979'></a><a href='#f979' class='c010'><sup>[979]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.3.28'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>R. H. Hutton.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The criticism of a critic just cited, the late Mr R. H.
Hutton, affords opportunity for at least a glance at one of
the most important general points connected with
our subject—the general distaste for pure criticism,
and the sort of relief which <span lang="fr"><i>l’homme sensuel moyen</i></span> seems to
feel when the bitter cup is allayed and sweetened by sentimental,
or political, or religious, or philosophical, or anthropological,
or pantopragmatic adulteration. Mr Hutton’s criticism was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>it is believed, by far the most popular of his day; the very
respectable newspaper which he directed was once eulogised
as “telling you what you <em>ought to</em> read, you know ”—a phrase
which might have awakened in a new Wordsworth thoughts too
deep for tears or even for laughter.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.29'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His evasions of literary criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The commentary on it is supplied by the two volumes of
Mr Hutton’s selected and collected <cite>Essays</cite>.<a id='r980'></a><a href='#f980' class='c010'><sup>[980]</sup></a> These constantly
deal with things and persons of the highest importance
in literature; but they abstain with a sort of
Pythagorean asceticism from the literary side of them.
In his repeated dealings with Carlyle, it is always as a man,
as a teacher, as a philosopher, as a politician, as a moralist,
that he handles that sage—never directly, or at most rapidly
and incidentally, as a writer. On Emerson he is a little more
literary, but not much: and on him also he slips away as
usual. Even with Poe, whom one might have thought literary
or nothing, he contrives to elude us, till his judgment on the
Poems suggests that <em>inability</em> to judge literature caused his
refusal. Dickens, Amiel, Mr Arnold himself—the most widely
differing persons and subjects—fail to tempt him into the
literary open; and it is a curious text for the sermon for
which we have here no room that he most nearly approaches
the actual literary criticism of verse, not on Tennyson, not on
“Poetry and Pessimism,” not on Mr Shairp’s <cite>Aspects of
Poetry</cite>, but on Lord Houghton. He goes to the ant and is
happy: with deans, and bishops, and archbishops, and cardinals
he is ready to play their own game. But if Literature, as
literature, makes any advances to him, he leaves his garment
in her hands and flees for his life.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.30'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Pater.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To assert too positively that Mr Walter Pater was the most
important English critic of the last generation of the nineteenth
century—that he stands  to that generation in a
relation resembling those of Coleridge to the first,
and Arnold to the latter part of the second—would no doubt
cause grumbles.   The Kingdom of Criticism has been of old
compared to that of Poland, and perhaps there is no closer
point  of  resemblance than the way in which critics, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>Polacks, cling to the <span lang="pl"><cite>Nie pozwalam</cite></span>, to the <span lang="la"><i>liberum veto</i></span>. So,
respecting this <span lang="pl"><i>jus Poloniæ</i></span> let us say that those are fair
reasons for advancing Mr Pater to such a position, while
admitting that he is somewhat less than either of his forerunners.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.31'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His frank Hedonism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>His minority consists certainly not in faculty of expression,
wherein he is the superior of both, nor in fineness of appreciation,
in which he is at least the equal of either:
but rather in a certain eclectic and composite
character, a want of definite four-square originality, which has
been remarkably and increasingly characteristic of the century
itself. In one point, indeed, he is almost entitled to the
highest place, but his claim here rests rather on a frank
avowal and formulation of what everybody had always more
or less admitted, or by denying had admitted the acceptance
of it by mankind at large—to wit, the <em>pleasure</em>-giving quality
of literature. Even he, however, resolute Hedonist as he was,
falters sometimes in this respect—is afraid of the plain
doctrine that the test of goodness in literature is simply and
solely the spurt of the match when soul of writer touches
reader’s soul, the light and the warmth that follow.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.32'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His</i> polytechny <i>and his style</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In two other main peculiarities or properties of his—the,
we will not say confusion but deliberate blending of different
arts in method and process, and the adoption
(modifying it, of course, by his own genius) of the
doctrine of the “single word,”—he is again more of
a transmitter than of a kindler of the torch. The first
proceeding had been set on foot by Lessing in the very act
of deprecating and exposing clumsy and blind anticipations
of it; the second was probably taken pretty straight from
Flaubert. But in the combination of all three, in the supplements
of mother-wit, and, above all, in the clothing of the
whole with an extraordinarily sympathetic and powerful
atmosphere of thought and style—in these things he stands
quite alone, and nearly as much so in his formulation of
that new critical attitude which we have seen in process of
development throughout the present volume.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.33'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His formulation of the new critical attitude.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The  documents  of  his  criticism are  to  be chiefly sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>in the <cite>Studies in the History of the Renaissance</cite>,<a id='r981'></a><a href='#f981' class='c010'><sup>[981]</sup></a> in parts of
<cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite>, and, of course, in the volume
of <cite>Appreciations</cite>, and the little collection of Essays
reprinted from <cite>The Guardian</cite>.<a id='r982'></a><a href='#f982' class='c010'><sup>[982]</sup></a>  The posthumous
books are less to he depended on, in consequence
of Mr Pater’s very strong tendency to <span lang="fr"><i>cuver son vin</i></span>—to alter
and digest and retouch. I do not know any place setting forth
that view of criticism which I have myself always held more
clearly than the Preface of the <cite>Studies</cite>. “To feel the virtue of
the poet, or the painter, to disengage it, to set it forth,—these
are the three stages of the critic’s duty.”  The first (Mr Pater
does not say this but we may) is a passion of pleasure, passing
into an action of inquiry; the second is that action consummated;
the third is the interpretation of the result to the world.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.34'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Renaissance.</div>

<p class='c001'>He never, I think, carried out his principles better than in
his first book, in regard to <span lang="fr"><cite>Aucassin et Nicolette</cite></span>, to Michelangelo,
to Du Bellay, as well as in parts of the “Pico”
and “Winckelmann” papers. But the method is
almost equally apparent and equally helpful in the more
purely “fine art” pieces—the “Lionardo,” the “Botticelli,” the
“Luca della Robbia.” In that passage on the three Madonnas
and the Saint Anne of Da Vinci, which I have always regarded
as the triumph both of his style and of his method,
the new doctrine (<em>not</em> the old) of <span lang="la"><i>ut pictura poesis</i></span> comes out
ten thousand strong for all its voluptuous softness. This is
the way to judge Keats and Tennyson as well as Lionardo:
nay, to judge poets of almost entirely different kinds, from
Æschylus through Dante to Shakespeare. Expose mind and
sense to them, like the plate of a camera: assist the reception
of the impression by cunning lenses of comparison, and history,
and hypothesis; shelter it with a cabinet of remembered reading
and corroborative imagination; develop it by meditation,
and print it off with the light of style:—there you have, in
but a coarse and half-mechanical analogy, the process itself.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span></div>
<a id='sec9.3.35'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Objections to its process.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I fancy that objections to this proceeding take something
like the following form: “In the first place, the thing is too
effeminate, too patient, too submissive,—it substitutes
a mere voluptuous enjoyment, and a dilettante
examination into the causes thereof, for a virile summoning of
the artist-culprit before the bar of Reason to give account of
his deeds. In the second, it is too facile, too <span lang="fr"><i>fainéant</i></span>. In
the third, it does not give sufficient advantage to the things
which we like to call ‘great.’ The moments of pleasure are too
much <em>atomised</em>: and though it may be admitted that some
yield larger, intenser, more continuous supplies of moment than
others, yet this is not sufficient.” Lastly [this is probably
always <span lang="fr"><i>subaud.</i></span>, but seldom uttered except by the hotter gospellers],
“<em>We</em> don’t believe in these ecstatic moments, analysed
and interpreted in tranquillity; we don’t feel them, and we
don’t want to feel them; and you are a nasty hedonist if you
do feel them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Which protest could, no doubt, be amplified, could, with no
doubt also, be supported to a certain extent. Nor is it (though
he should placard frankly the fact that he agrees in the main
with Mr Pater) exactly the business of the present historian to
defend it at any length here, inasmuch as he is writing a
history, not a “suasory.” Let it only be hinted in passing
that the exceptions just stated seem inconclusive—that the
wanters of a sense cannot plead their want as an argument
that no others have it; that the process has certainly given
no despicable results; that it has seldom demonstrably failed
as disastrously as the antecedent rule-system; and, most of
all, that nothing can be falser than the charge of <span lang="fr"><i>fainéantise</i></span>
and dilettanteism. Only as “the last corollary of many of an
effort” can this critical skill also be attained and maintained.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.36'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Importance of</i> Marius the Epicurean.</div>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, though, as often happens to a man, he became
rather more of a preceptist and less of an impressionist afterwards,
Mr Pater certainly exemplified this general
theory and practice in a very notable manner.
<cite>Marius</cite> is full of both: it is much more than the
<cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite> of the New Criticism. It is this
which gives the critical attitude of Flavian, the hero’s friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>and inspirer, the supposed author of the <cite>Pervigilium</cite>; this,
which is the literary function of “Neo-Cyrenaicism” itself—the
μονόχρονος ἡδονή, the integral atom, or moment of pleasure,
being taken as the unit and reference-integer of literary value;
this, which gives the adjustment <span lang="la"><i>ad hoc</i></span> of the <cite>Hermotimus</cite>.
The theory and the practice take their most solid, permanent,
and important form in this most remarkable book, of which
I find it hard to believe that the copy, “From the Author,”
which lies before me, reached me nearly twenty years ago.
The <cite>Renaissance</cite> holds the first blooms and promises of them;
<cite>Appreciations</cite> and the <cite>Guardian Essays</cite> the later applications
and developments; but the central gospel is here.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.37'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Appreciations <i>and the</i> “Guardian” <i>Essays</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>That the opening essays of these two latter books happen
to contain references to myself is a fact. But I fancy that
this will not be the main interest of them to
posterity, nor, strange as it may seem, is it their
main interest to me.<a id='r983'></a><a href='#f983' class='c010'><sup>[983]</sup></a> The Essay on <em>Style</em> which
opens the larger and  more  important  book, is, I
think, on the whole, the most valuable thing yet written
on that much-written-about subject. It presents, indeed, as
I have hinted, a certain appearance of “hedging,” especially
in the return to matter as the distinction between “good
art” and “great art,” which return, as easily rememberable
and with a virtuous high sound in it, appears to have
greatly comforted some good if not great souls. Certainly
a pitcher of gold is in some senses greater than a pitcher
of pewter of the same design, especially if you wish to dispose
of it to Mr Polonius. A pewter amphora is again in some
senses greater than a pewter cyathus. But it does not seem
to me that this helps us much. How good, on the other hand,
and how complete, is that improvement upon Coleridge’s dictum,
which makes Style consist in the adequate presentation of
the writer’s “sense of fact,” and the criticism of the documents
adduced! How valuable the whole, though we may notice as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>to the writer’s selection of <em>prose</em> literature as the representative
art of the nineteenth century, that this was <em>his</em> art, his in
consummate measure, and that verse was not. Altogether,
in short, a great paper,—a “furthest” in certain directions.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is an interesting tender, or rather pilot-boat, to this
Essay in the first of the <cite>Guardian</cite> Reviews on “English Literature,”
where the texts are the present writer’s <cite>Specimens</cite>,
Professor’s Minto’s <cite>English Poets</cite>, Mr Dobson’s <cite>Selections from
Steele</cite>, and one of Canon Ainger’s many bits of yeoman’s service
to Lamb. The relation is repeated between the Wordsworth
Essay in <cite>Appreciations</cite> and a Wordsworth review among the
<cite>Guardian</cite> sheaf: while something not dissimilar, but even more
intimate, exists between the “Coleridge” Essay and the introduction
to that poet in Mr Ward’s well-known book, which
Introduction actually forms part of the Essay itself. In the
two former cases, actual passages and phrases from the smaller,
earlier, and less important work also appear in the larger
and later. For Mr Pater—as was very well known, when more
than thirty years ago it was debated in Oxford whether he
would ever publish anything at all, and as indeed might have
been seen from his very first work, by any one with an eye,
but with no personal knowledge—was in no sense a ready writer,
and, least of all, anxious to write as he ran, that those who run
might read. There have been critics who, without repeating
themselves, and even, perhaps, with some useful additions
and variations, could write half a dozen times on the same
subject; and indeed most literary subjects admit of such
writing. But such (we need not say frivolity but) flexibility
was not in accordance with Mr Pater’s temperament.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is hardly one of the papers in either book (though
some of the <cite>Guardian</cite> pieces are simple, yet quite honest and
adequate reviews) that does not display that critical attitude
which we have defined above, both directly and in relation to
the subjects. The most interesting and important passages
are those which reveal in the critic, or recognise in his authors,
this attitude itself—as when we read of Amiel: “In Switzerland
it is easy to be pleased with scenery. But the record of
such pleasure becomes really worth while when, as happens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>with A., we feel that there has been and, with success, an
intellectual effort to get at the secret, the precise motive, of
this pleasure—to define feeling.” Indeed, I really do not
know that “to define feeling” is not as good—it is certainly
as short—a definition of at least a great part of the business
of the critic as you can get. And so again of Lamb: “To
feel strongly the charm of an old poet or moralist,... and
then to interpret that charm, to convey it to others,... this
is the way of his criticism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is certainly the way of Mr Pater’s, and it is always good
to walk with him in it—better, I venture to think, than to
endeavour to follow him in his rarer and never quite successful
attempts to lift himself off it, and flutter in the vague. Good,
for instance, as is the Essay on “Æsthetic Poetry,” it would
have been far better if it had contented itself with being, in
fact and in name, what it is in its best parts—a review of
Mr William Morris.<a id='r984'></a><a href='#f984' class='c010'><sup>[984]</sup></a> This, however, was written very early,
and before he had sent out his spies to the Promised Land in
<cite>The Renaissance</cite> (and they had brought back mighty bunches
of grapes!), still more before he had reached the Pisgah of
<cite>Marius</cite>. Even here though, and naturally still more in the
much later paper on Rossetti, he presents us, as he does almost
everywhere, with admirable, sometimes with consummate, examples
of “defined feeling” about Wordsworth and Coleridge,
about Browning and Lamb, about Sir Thomas Browne (one of
his most memorable things), about more modern persons—Mr
Gosse, M. Fabre, M. Filon. Particularly precious are the three
papers on Shakespeare. I have always wished that Mr Pater
had given us more of them, as well as others on authors possessing
more of what we may call the <em>positive</em> quality, than
those whom he actually selected. It would, I think, speaking
without impertinence, have done him some good: and it would,
speaking with certainty, have done us a great deal. One may
sometimes think that it was in his case (as in some others,
though so few!) almost a pity that he was in a position to
write mainly for amusement. But it is not likely that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>sequestered and sensitive genius could ever have done its best—if
it could have done anything at all—at forced draught.
So, as usual, things are probably better as they are.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.38'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Universality of his method.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>What, however, is not probable but certain, and what is
here of most importance, is that the Paterian method is co-extensive
in possibility of application with the
entire range of criticism—from the long and slow
degustation and appreciation of a Dante or a
Shakespeare to the rapidest adequate review of the most
trivial and ephemeral of books. Feel; discover the source of
feeling (or no feeling, or disgust, as it will often be in the
trivial cases); express the discovery so as to communicate the
feeling: this can be done in every case. And if it cannot be
done by every person, why, that is only equivalent to saying
that it is not precisely possible for everybody to be a critic,
which, again, is a particular case of a general proposition
announced in choice Latin a long time ago, practically anticipated
in choicer Greek long before, and no doubt perfectly well
understood by wise persons of all nations and languages at
any time back to the Twenty-third of October <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 4004, or
any other date which may be preferred thereto. Besides the
objections before referred to, there may be others—such as
that the critic’s powers, even if he possesses them, will become
callous by too much exercise,—an objection refuted by the fact,
so often noticed, that there is hardly an instance of a man
with real critical powers becoming a worse critic as he grew
older, and many a one of his becoming a better. But, at
any rate, this was Mr Pater’s way of criticism: this had
already been the way pursued, more or less darkling or in
clear vision, by all modern critics—the way first definitely
formulated, and, perhaps, allowing for bulk of work, most
consistently pursued, by himself. And I have said—perhaps

<p class='c001'>Although the relation of “moon” to “sun,” so often used
as an image in literary history, will not work with pedantic
exactness in relation to Mr J. A. Symonds and the
critic just mentioned,—for the moon is not many
times more voluminous than the sun, and there are other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>difficulties,—it applies to a certain extent. Both were literary
Hedonists; both were strongly influenced by Greek and Italian.
But Mr Symonds’s mind, like his style, was very much more
irregular and undisciplined than Mr Pater’s (which had almost
something of Neo-classic precision adjusting its Romantic luxuriance),
and this want of discipline let him loose<a id='r985'></a><a href='#f985' class='c010'><sup>[985]</sup></a> into a
loquacity which certainly deserved the Petronian epithet of
<span lang="la"><i>enormis</i></span>, and could sometimes hardly escape the companion one
of <span lang="la"><i>ventosa</i></span>. His treatise on <cite>Blank Verse</cite>,<a id='r986'></a><a href='#f986' class='c010'><sup>[986]</sup></a> interesting as it is,
would give the enemy of the extremer “modern” criticism far
too many occasions to blaspheme by its sheer critical anti-nomianism:
and over all his extensive work, faults of excess
of various kinds swarm. But beauties and merits are there
in ample measure as well as faults: and in the literary parts
of <cite>The Renaissance in Italy</cite> the author has endeavoured to put
some restraint on himself, and has been rewarded for the sacrifice.
From some little acquaintance with literary history,
I think I may say that there is no better historical treatment
of a foreign literature in English. One can never help
wishing that the author had left half his actual subject untouched,
and had completed the study of Italian literature.<a id='r987'></a><a href='#f987' class='c010'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.3.40'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Thomson (“B. V.”)</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Not much need be said of the critical production—arrested,
like the poetical, by causes unhappy but well known—of
James Thomson “the Second,” hardly “the Less,”
but most emphatically “the Other.” It ought to
have been good: and sometimes (especially under the unexpected
and soothing shadow of <cite>Cope’s Tobacco Plant</cite>) was so.<a id='r988'></a><a href='#f988' class='c010'><sup>[988]</sup></a>
Thomson had much of the love, and some of the knowledge,
required; his intellect (when allowed to be so) was clear and
strong; he was, in more ways than one, of the type of those
poets who have made some of the best critics, despite the
alleged prodigiousness of the metamorphosis. But the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>seed was choked by many tares of monstrous and fatal growth.
The least of these should have been (but perhaps was not) the
necessity of working for a living, and not the necessity, but
the provoked and accepted doom, of working for it mostly in
obscure and unprofitable, not to say disreputable, places,
imposed upon a temperament radically nervous, “impotent,”
in the Latin sense, and unresigned to facts. That temperament
itself was a more dangerous obstacle: and the recalcitrance to
religion which it was allowed to induce was one more dangerous
still. There are no doubt many instances where rigid
orthodoxy has proved baneful, even destructive, to a man’s
critical powers, or at any rate to his catholic exertion of them:
but there are also many in which it has interfered little, if
at all. On the other hand, I can hardly think of a case in
which religious, and of very few in which political, heterodoxy
has not made its partisans more or less hopelessly uncritical
on those with whom they disagree. Nor could the peculiar
character of Thomson’s education and profession fail to react
unfavourably on his criticism. It is hard to get rid of some
ill effects of schoolmastering in any case; it must be nearly
impossible, in the case of a proud and rather “ill-conditioned”
man, who has not enjoyed either full liberal education or gentle
breeding, and who is between the upper and nether millstone,
as Thomson seems to have been, or at least felt himself, while
he was a military schoolmaster. All these irons entered into
a critical soul which might have been a fair one and brave:
and we see the scars of them, and the cramp of them, too
often.<a id='r989'></a><a href='#f989' class='c010'><sup>[989]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.3.41'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>William Minto.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A journalist for one-half of his working life, and a professor—partly—of
literature for the other, William Minto executed
in both capacities a good deal of literary work: but
his most noteworthy contribution<a id='r990'></a><a href='#f990' class='c010'><sup>[990]</sup></a> to our subject
consisted in the two remarkable manuals of English literary
history which, as quite a young man, he drew up.<a id='r991'></a><a href='#f991' class='c010'><sup>[991]</sup></a> To say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>that these manuals were at the time of their publication by
far the best on the subject would be to say little: for there
were hardly any good ones. Their praise can be more of a
cheerfully positive, and less of a “rascally, comparative”
character. They were both, but especially the <cite>Poets from
Chaucer to Shirley</cite>, full of study, insight, originality, and grasp—where
the author chose to indulge his genius. <a id='sec9.3.42'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His books on English Prose and Poetry.</i></span> Their defects
were defects which it requires genius indeed, or at
least a very considerable share of audacity, to keep
out of manuals of the kind. There is, perhaps, too
much biography and too much mere abstract of
contents—a thing which will never serve the student in lieu
of reading, which will sometimes disastrously suggest to him
that he need not read, and which must always curtail the
space available for really useful guidance and critical illumination
to him when he does. In the <cite>Prose</cite> there is something
else. The book is constructed as a sort of enlarged <span lang="la"><i>praxis</i></span> on
a special pedagogic theory of style-teaching, that of the late
Professor Bain: and is elaborately scheduled for the illustration
of Qualities and Elements of Style, of Kinds of Composition.
There is no need to discuss how far the schedule itself is faulty
or free from fault; it is unavoidable that rigid adjustment to
it—or to any such—shall bring back those faults of the old
Rhetoric on which we commented in vol. i., with others more
faulty than themselves. For classical literature was very
largely, if not wholly, constructed according to such schemes,
and might be analysed with an eye on them: English literature
had other inceptions and other issues. That Minto’s excellent
critical qualities do not disappear altogether behind the lattice-work
of schedule-reference speaks not a little for them.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.43'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>H. D. Traill.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Few writers have lost more by the practice of anonymous
journalism than the late Mr Traill. He engaged
in it, and in periodical writing generally, from a
period dating back almost to the time of his leaving Oxford,<a id='r992'></a><a href='#f992' class='c010'><sup>[992]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>he had to do with it, I believe, till his death, the extraordinary
quality of his work recommending him to any and every editor
who knew his business. It was impossible, in reading any
proof of his, be it on matters political, literary, or miscellaneous,
not to think of Thackeray’s phrase about George Warrington’s
articles, as to “the sense, the satire, and the scholarship”
which characterised them. In the rather wide knowledge,
which circumstances happened to give me, of writers for the
press during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, I
never knew his equal for combination of the three. <a id='sec9.3.44'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His critical strength.</i></span> For a
great many years, however, chance, or choice, or demand,
directed him chiefly to the most important, as it
is thought, and the most paying, but the most
exhausting and, as far as permanent results go, the most
utterly thankless and evanescent division of journalism—political
leader-writing, with actual attendance at “the House”
during the Session. And this curtailed both his literary
press-work and his opportunities of literary book-work. He
did, however, a great deal of the former: and the labours of
the much-abused but sometimes useful literary resurrection-men,
who dig contributions out of their newspaper graves, could
hardly be better bestowed than upon him. Fortunately, however,
the literary side of his criticism—he was a critic of
letters and life alike, born and bred, in prose and in verse,
by temper and training, in heart and brain—remains in part
of <cite>The New Lucian</cite>, in the admirable monographs on Sterne
and Coleridge,<a id='r993'></a><a href='#f993' class='c010'><sup>[993]</sup></a> and in the collection of Essays<a id='r994'></a><a href='#f994' class='c010'><sup>[994]</sup></a> issued but a
year or two before his death.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.45'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Sterne and Coleridge.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the three last-named volumes especially, his qualities
as a critic are patent to any one with eyes.  The two monographs
are models of competence and grasp, but
they are almost greater models of the combination
of vigour and sanity. Both subjects are of the
kind which used to tempt to cant, and which now tempts to
paradox. To the first sin Mr Traill had no temptation—whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>fault might have been found with him, neither Pecksniffery
nor Podsnappery was in the faintest degree his failing.
But he might have been thought likely to be tempted, as some
very clever men in our day have been, by the desire to fly
in the face of the Philistine, and to flout the Family Man.
There is no trace of any such beguilement—the moral currency
is as little tampered with as it could have been by Johnson
or by Southey, while there is no trace of the limitations of
the one or of the slight Pharisaism of the other. And yet
the literary judgment is entirely unaffected by this moral
rectitude: the two do not trespass on each other’s provinces
by so much as a hair’s-breadth.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.46'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Essays on Fiction.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The title-paper of the collected <cite>Essays</cite>, “The New Fiction,”
connects itself with several other pieces in the volume, “The
Political Novel,” “Samuel Richardson,” “The Novel
of Manners,” and, to some extent, “The Future of
Humour.” Mr Traill was a particularly good critic of the most
characteristic product of the nineteenth century: I doubt
whether we have had a better. In poetry he seemed to me
to sin a little, in one direction (just as, I know, I seemed to
him to sin in the other), by insisting, too much in the antique
fashion, on a general unity and purpose. He shows this, I
think, here in the paper on “Matthew Arnold,” who, indeed,
himself could hardly have objected, for they were theoretically
much at one on the point. But as to prose fiction he had no
illusions, and his criticism of it is consummate. We have not
a few instances of onslaughts upon corrupt developments of the
art by critics great and small; but I do not think I know one to
equal Mr Traill’s demolition of the “<em>grime</em>-novel” of to-day or
yesterday. <a id='sec9.3.47'></a><span class='sni side9'>“<cite>The Future of Humour.</cite>”</span> His highest achievement, however, in a single piece,
is undoubtedly “The Future of Humour,” which
transcends mere reviewing, transcends the mere
<span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span>, and unites the merits of both with those of the best
kind of abstract critical discussion. One may say of it, without
hesitation, <span lang="fr"><i>Ça restera</i></span>; it may be lost in the mass, now and
then, but whenever a good critic comes across it he will restore
it to its place. It is <em>about</em> a day, but not <em>of</em> or <em>for</em> it: it moves,
and has its being, as do all masterpieces of art, small and great,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span><span lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span>.  If it were not so idle, one could only sigh
at thinking how many a leading article, how much journey-work
in biography, one would give for Traill to be alive again,
and to write such criticism as this.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.48'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Others: Mansel, Venables, Stephen, Lord Houghton, Pattison, Church, &#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Others, great and small, we must once more sweep into the
<span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span> named, or unnamed. Mr Traill himself—for they were
both of St John’s—may be said to have directly
inherited the mantle of Dean Mansel in respect of
critical wit and sense, though the Dean had only
occasionally devoted these qualities, together with
his great philosophical powers, and his admirable
style, to pure literary criticism.<a id='r995'></a><a href='#f995' class='c010'><sup>[995]</sup></a> Of the immense
critical exercise of Mr George Venables, a little
lacking in flexibility, sympathy, and unction, but excellently
sound and strong, no salvage, I think, has ever been published:
and though a good deal is available from his yoke-fellow, Sir
James Fitzjames Stephen,<a id='r996'></a><a href='#f996' class='c010'><sup>[996]</sup></a> this latter’s tastes—as his father’s
had done before, though in a different direction—led him away
from the purer literary criticism. Of three other persons,
eminent in their several ways, more substantive notice may
perhaps have been expected by many, and will certainly be
demanded by some. But Lord Houghton’s <cite>Monographs</cite>,<a id='r997'></a><a href='#f997' class='c010'><sup>[997]</sup></a> admirably
written and extremely interesting to read, hardly
present a sufficiently individual kind, or a sufficiently considerable
bulk of matter, for a separate paragraph. Mr Mark
Pattison’s dealings with Milton and with Pope, as well as
with the great seventeenth-century scholars, may seem more,
and more imperatively, to knock for admission. As far as
scholarship, in almost every sense of the word, is concerned, no
critic can surpass him; but scholarship, though all but indispensable
as the critic’s <em>canvass</em>, needs much working upon,
and over, to give the finished result. And Pattison’s incurable
reticence and recalcitrance—the temperament which requires
the French words <span lang="fr"><i>rêche</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>revêche</i></span>, if not even <em>rogue</em>, to label it—were
rebel to the suppleness and <em>morigeration</em> which are required
from all but mere scholastic critics. The happier stars or complexion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>of his near contemporary, Dean Church, enabled him to
do some admirable critical work on Dante, on Spenser, and on
not a few others, which will be found in the <cite>English Men of
Letters</cite>, in Mr Ward’s <cite>Poets</cite>, in his own Collected <cite>Essays</cite>, and in
separate books. Dr Church combined, with an excellent style,
much scholarship and a judgment as sane as it was mild, nor
did he allow the natural drift of his mind towards ethical and
religious, rather than purely literary, considerations to draw
him too much away from the latter.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.49'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Patmore.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Coventry Patmore has been extolled to the skies by a
coterie. But to the cool outsider his criticism, like his poetry,
has somewhat too much the character of “diamondiferous
rubbish,”—a phrase which, when applied to
the poetry itself, did not, I am told, displease him. For
though, in <cite>Principle in Art</cite><a id='r998'></a><a href='#f998' class='c010'><sup>[998]</sup></a> and <span lang="la"><cite>Religio Poetæ</cite></span><a id='r999'></a><a href='#f999' class='c010'><sup>[999]</sup></a> there may
be a few things rich and rare, there is a very large surplusage
of the <em>other</em> constituents of the mixture. The short
articles of the first volume consist almost wholly of it, and
might have been left in the columns of the Daily Paper in
which they appeared with a great deal of advantage.<a id='r1000'></a><a href='#f1000' class='c010'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> Indeed
those on Keats, Shelley, Blake, and Rossetti, which unfortunately
follow each other, make a four-in-hand good only for the
knacker. Mr Patmore, when he wrote them, was too old to
take the benefit of <em>no</em>-clergy, to be allowed the use of undergraduate
paradox. And as, unfortunately, he was a craftsfellow,
and a craftsfellow not very popular or highly valued
with most people, his denigration is all the more awkward.
A man who says that <cite>The Burden of Nineveh</cite> “might have been
written by Southey” (and I do not undervalue Southey), must
have an insensible spot somewhere in his critical body. A man
who says that Blake’s poetry, “with the exception of four or
five pieces and a gleam here and there,” is mere drivel, must be
suffering from critical hemiplegia. There are better things in
the other volume, and its worst faults are excesses of praise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>always less disgusting, though not always less uncritical, than
those of blame. But I am not here giving a full examination
to Mr Patmore’s criticism, I am only indicating why I do not
here examine it, as I am perfectly ready to do at any moment
in a proper place.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.50'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Mr Edmund Gurney.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There were, I think, few English writers of the last quarter of
the nineteenth century who showed more of the true critical <em>ethos</em>
than the late Mr Edmund Gurney. I did not know
Mr Gurney myself, but most of my friends did; a
situation in which there is special danger (when the friends are
complimentary) of the fate of Aristides for the other person.
But the good things which were told me of Mr Gurney I find
to be very much more than confirmed by his books, though, of
course, I also find plenty to disagree with. The earlier of them,
<cite>The Power of Sound</cite>,<a id='r1001'></a><a href='#f1001' class='c010'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> is in the main musical; and I have
generally found (though there are some capital exceptions) that
critics of poetry, or of literature generally, who start from much
musical knowledge, are profoundly unsatisfactory, inasmuch as
they rarely appreciate the radical difference between musical
music and poetical music. Even Mitford fails here. But Mr
Gurney does not. He was the first, or one of the first, I think,
in English to enunciate formally the great truth that “the
setting includes a new substance”—meaning not merely the
technical music-setting of the composer, but that “sound accompaniment”
which, in all poetry more or less, and in
English poetry of the nineteenth century especially, gives
a bonus, adds a <span lang="fr"><i>panache</i></span>, to the meaning.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.51'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>The Power of Sound.</div>

<p class='c001'>He was right too, I have not the slightest doubt, in laying it
down that “metrical rhythm is imposed upon, not latent in,
speech”; and he went right, where too many scholars
of high repute have gone wrong, in seeing that the
much-decried English scansion-pronunciation of Latin almost
certainly brings out <em>to an English ear</em> the effect on a Latin one,
better than any conjectured attempt to mimic what might have
been the Latin pronunciation itself. I was delighted to find that
he, too, had fixed upon Tennyson’s “Fair is her cottage” (his is
not quite my view, and perhaps we were both guided by a reported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>speech of Mr Spedding’s) as almost the <span lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of
“superadded” audible and visual effect combined. And he
is well worth reading on certain “illusions” of Lessing’s.</p>

<a id='sec9.3.52'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Tertium Quid.</div>

<p class='c001'>The literary part of <cite>The Power of Sound</cite> is, however, if not
accidental, incidental mainly: not a few of the papers in the
second volume of <cite>Tertium Quid</cite><a id='r1002'></a><a href='#f1002' class='c010'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> deal with literature
pure and simple. They are to some extent
injured by the fact that many, if not most of them, are merely
strokes, or parries, or <span lang="fr"><i>ripostes</i></span>, in particular duels or <span lang="fr"><i>mêlées</i></span> on
dependences of the moment. And, as I have pointed out
in reference to certain famous altercations of the past, these
critical squabbles seem to me almost invariably to darken
counsel—first, by leading the disputants away from the true
points, and secondly, by inducing them to mix in their pleadings
all sorts of flimsy, ephemeral, and worthless matter. Not
the point, but what Jones or Brown has said about the point,
becomes the object of the writer’s attention; he wants to score
off Brown or Jones, not to score for the truth. So when Mr
Gurney contended with the late Mr Hueffer—another literary-musical
critic, who did <em>not</em>, as Mr Gurney did, escape the
dangers of the double employ—when he contributed not so
much a <span lang="la"><i>tertium</i></span> as a <span lang="la"><i>quartum quid</i></span> to the triangular duel of Mr
Arnold, Mr Austin, Mr Swinburne about Byron—he did not
always say what is still worth reading. And he makes one
or two odd blunders, such as that the French are blind to
Wordsworth, whereas Wordsworth’s influence on Sainte-Beuve,
to name nobody else,<a id='r1003'></a><a href='#f1003' class='c010'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> was very great. But he is always
sensible,<a id='r1004'></a><a href='#f1004' class='c010'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> and he always has that double soundness on the
passionate side of poetry and on the peculiar appeal of its
form, which is so rare and so distinctive of the good critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>These qualities should, of course, appear in his essay on
the “Appreciation of Poetry”;<a id='r1005'></a><a href='#f1005' class='c010'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> and they do. It is, however,
perhaps well to note that, while quite sound on the point
that there is a right as well as a wrong comparison, he, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>others, hardly escapes the further danger of “confusing the
confusion”—of taking what is really the right comparison for
what is really the wrong. The comparison which disapproves
one thing because it is unlike another is wrong, not the comparison
which is used to bring out a fault, though the unlikeness
is not assigned as the reason of the fault at all. But I
am here slipping from history to doctrine on this particular
point. I think Mr Gurney, right in the main, might have
been still <em>righter</em>: but in general I am sure that he had admirable
critical qualities, and I only wish he had chosen, or
had been forced, to use them more fully and frequently.<a id='r1006'></a><a href='#f1006' class='c010'><sup>[1006]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r962'>962</a>. The immortality of critical error—the
impossibility of quelling the
Blatant Beast—to which we have
alluded (ii. 554, note) is again illustrated
here. One might have thought
that Mr Arnold had sufficiently crushed
and concluded this fallacy. It has

<p class='c001'><a href='#r964'>964</a>. Mr Arnold never explicitly retracted
this “pyramidal” exaggeration—it

<p class='c007'>The volume of critical writing in Germany since Goethe’s
death, and the deaths of those younger contemporaries of his,
like Tieck and A. W. Schlegel, who were mentioned in our
last chapter on the subject,<a id='r1007'></a><a href='#f1007' class='c010'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> has been, of course, very great.
The unceasing literary and scientific industry of the nation
(with, in particular, the habit of the doctoral thesis forming
almost an obligatory part of the regular education of any man
pretending to culture) has made books of more or less critical
intent and content as the sands of the sea. Yet the determination
of the national critical temperament towards abstract æsthetic,
or towards the most rudimentary and literal duties of <span lang="de"><cite>Quellenforschung</cite></span>,
of tabulation of rhyme and word-form, and the like,
together with the custom (most fatal of all those encouraged
by the thesis habit) of constantly “shoddying-up” former inquiries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>into fresher form, has prevented much of the very
best kind of work from being done. If it were not for Heine,
Schopenhauer, and one other who may come more as a surprise,
in the earlier part, and the singular, erratic, and mainly
wasted genius of Nietzsche in the later, this chapter would
cut a very rueful figure beside most others in the book. Nor
was any one of these primarily a literary critic.<a id='r1008'></a><a href='#f1008' class='c010'><sup>[1008]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.4.1'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Heine: deceptiveness of his criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Heinrich Heine<a id='r1009'></a><a href='#f1009' class='c010'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> did many wonderful and many delightful
things; but though he certainly did many things more delightful,
I do not know that he ever did anything
more wonderful than in making <span lang="de"><cite>Die Romantische
Schule</cite></span> persuade divers folk that he, the author of
the <span lang="de"><cite>Nord-See</cite></span> in his morning, the author of Bimini
when the night had almost fallen, was anything but a Romantic
himself. This curious achievement shows the dangers that
wait upon those who peruse his criticism. If they cannot remember
that a man very frequently blasphemes, in jest or
temper, what he loves and adores, if they have not graven
on their souls Lamb’s lines which culminate in</p>

<p class='c009'>they had much better not read Heine at all. For he will lead
them into many foolish and hurtful errors, and direct them,
as by his own account he actually did certain poor people in
his impish days, to the sign of the Stone Jug as the most
comfortable and respectable hotel in Göttingen.<a id='r1010'></a><a href='#f1010' class='c010'><sup>[1010]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.4.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>In the</i> Romantische Schule, <i>and elsewhere</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>To put at  once  out  of  controversy what ought never to
have been in it, let any one compare  the  famous passage or
passages in <cite>The Romantic School</cite><a id='r1011'></a><a href='#f1011' class='c010'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> about the Schlegels,
with all their fantastic and contemptuous satire, and
the serious passage about them in the much less
well-known article on Menzel.<a id='r1012'></a><a href='#f1012' class='c010'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> Nay, let any man
accustomed to sift evidence compare the more serious part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>the “Romantic School” passages themselves with the less
serious ones, and he will not have much doubt left on the
manner. Heine was not only one of those persons who “cannot
get enough fighting,” but one of those who always prefer the
most fantastic, the most unconventional, I fear one must in
some cases say the most unsportsmanlike, tactics and methods.
He would have liked the <span lang="fr"><i>savate</i></span> better than the formal rules
of the English ring, with their pruderies about hitting below
the belt and using your feet: and I think his favourite weapon
would have been that ingenious Irish implement the
Gae-Bulg, with which the great Cuchullain slew somebody
else nearly as great whose name abides not with me—a short,
many-barbed harpoon which you kicked from between your
toes upwards, into the under and unprotected part of the
opponent’s stomach. The Middle Ages were actually the most
representative times of Christian literature: and had been
made even too much of as such by the school he was attacking.
This offended his Judaism, that equally passionate and unpractical
form of religion. He knew—it is one of his great
critical deliverances—that if the Romantic is not always the
mediæval, the mediæval is almost always the Romantic. And
so at times there was no mercy for mediævalism and Romanticism.
At other times he went and wrote, or had already written,
<cite>Don Ramiro</cite> and <span lang="de"><cite>Das Liedchen von der Reue</cite></span>, and <span lang="de"><cite>Mein süsses
Lieb, wenn du im Grab</cite></span>, and <span lang="de"><cite>Die alten bösen Lieder</cite></span>, and <span lang="de"><cite>Ich bin
die Prinzessin Ilse</cite></span>, and the best things in the <span lang="de"><cite>Nord-See</cite></span> itself,
and the nineteenth chapter of <span lang="de"><cite>Atta Troll</cite></span>, and nearly the whole
of the <span lang="de"><cite>Romancero</cite></span>, and <span lang="de"><cite>Bimini</cite></span>!</p>

<a id='sec9.4.3'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The qualities and delights of it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>With such a man the critical letter killeth, unless you
crush the snake on the wound, and, as the scientific
people say now (justifying, like all real new
wisdom, the wisdom of old), set free the antidote
which the snake’s own blood contains for its own safety
against its venom. Never was any so liberal of this antidote,
without even the trouble of crushing, so easy to charm, so
<em>self-charming</em>, as Heine. As he says himself,<a id='r1013'></a><a href='#f1013' class='c010'><sup>[1013]</sup></a> “the laughter
sticks in his throat,” too often and too evidently: and all but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>the dullest ears should hear the sob that chokes it. But,
unfortunately, there are ears in this world that <em>are</em> dull of
hearing; there are even several of them. And for these, as
a critic, Heine is not.<a id='r1014'></a><a href='#f1014' class='c010'><sup>[1014]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For others he is perhaps the chief, and certainly one of
the earliest, of those who have discovered that the Goddess of
Criticism is really all the different Muses in turn, and that she
can be Thalia as well as Clio. There is still an idea that the
critic ought to be very serious: and this Heine certainly was
not—at least consecutively—while he was not even quite
master of his own seriousness when he had it. There is, for
an Englishman, no more agreeable spectacle of the kind than
the delightful struggle of Shakespeareolatry and Anglophobia
in <span lang="de"><cite>Shakespeare’s Mädchen und Frauen</cite></span>.<a id='r1015'></a><a href='#f1015' class='c010'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> All the Victor Hugo
passages<a id='r1016'></a><a href='#f1016' class='c010'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> should be carefully compared, remembering of
course that the half of Hugo had not been told to Heine. So
should all the Goethe pieces,<a id='r1017'></a><a href='#f1017' class='c010'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> remembering, again, the interview,
when the younger poet could find nothing to say to
the elder but that the wayside plums between Jena and Weimar
were good. Read him on Hoffmann and Novalis,<a id='r1018'></a><a href='#f1018' class='c010'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> and remember
that it is not exactly everybody—not even every Heine (if indeed
there could be more Heines than one)—that can appreciate
Novalis <i>and</i> Hoffmann together. In fact read him everywhere:
but whenever you begin to read him, remember two little
sentences of his, and if you cannot understand and enjoy them,
shut the book. The one is that<a id='r1019'></a><a href='#f1019' class='c010'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> about the orange-trees at
Sans-Souci whereof “every one has its number, like a contributor
to Brockhaus’s <span lang="de"><cite>Konversationsblatte</cite></span>.” The other is the
pronouncement that “without the Will of the Lord no sparrow
falls from the housetop, and Government-Councillor Karl
Streckfuss makes no verse.” These will serve as useful tuning-forks,
and they are not difficult to carry about and use.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fine, Heine is a dangerous model, no doubt; yet even
as a model he gave something to Criticism which it had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>possessed before, which even Voltaire was unable to give it,
because <em>his</em> laughter was too far removed from tears. Heine’s
humour too often turned to the humoursome: but it was
always present. And Humour is to the critic very nearly what
Unction is to the preacher, in its virtue as well as in its danger.
Moreover if he could certainly hate he could as certainly love—could
not help loving. And when you find Love and Humour
together, they and you are not far from the critical Kingdom
of Heaven.<a id='r1020'></a><a href='#f1020' class='c010'><sup>[1020]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.4.4'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Schopenhauer.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The critical work of Schopenhauer<a id='r1021'></a><a href='#f1021' class='c010'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> is partly to be found
in his great book, but it there assumes forms which are not
of those with which we chiefly busy ourselves, while
the critical sections of the <span lang="de"><cite>Parerga und Paralipomena</cite></span><a id='r1022'></a><a href='#f1022' class='c010'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>
are ours—“stock, lock, and barrel”—a familiar metaphor
which ceases to be hackneyed in face of the peculiar combativeness
of Schopenhauer’s thought and style. They have all
the refreshing quality of audacious originality and crisp phrase,<a id='r1023'></a><a href='#f1023' class='c010'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>
and they have perhaps less than is the case elsewhere the perverseness—in
fact, the mere ill-temper—which was the result,
partly of his dreary creed, partly of the injustice with which
he considered himself to be treated by the <span lang="de"><cite>Verdammte Race</cite></span>.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.5'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Vividness and originality of his critical observation.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In these latter moods he is sometimes very amusing, as
where he speaks of “a disgusting jargon like the French,”<a id='r1024'></a><a href='#f1024' class='c010'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> or
whenever he mentions Fichte, Schelling, or Hegel; but in
them few men are critical, and Schopenhauer is certainly not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>one of the few.  One might make a not uninteresting critical
postil or <span lang="la"><i>annotatiuncula</i></span> on the enthusiasm of this

the best thing, I think, that has ever been written
on that subject in German, and one of the best things ever
written in any language.  It is conspicuously free from the
old jest (repeated after Diderot on Beccaria so often) that there
is nothing of his subject in his treatment; and we may forgive
him for denouncing Parenthesis, when we remember the
misconduct of the Germans towards that delightfullest of
Figures.  Among his numerous judgments, of more wisdom
than mercy, none is better suited for these times (in which
the evil, bad in his own, has grown worse) than his condemnation
of the idea that “the last work is always the best,”
that “what is written later is always an improvement on what
was written before.”<a id='r1026'></a><a href='#f1026' class='c010'><sup>[1026]</sup></a>  Nor is Schopenhauer’s anathema on

<p class='c001'>Nor (as though he could leave no literary fault of his and our
time untransfixed) does he spare the labour lost on biography
and inquiry into originals and the like—“the analysing,”
as he calls it, “of clay and paint instead of admiring the shape
and colour of the vase.”<a id='r1028'></a><a href='#f1028' class='c010'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>  No critic, who is not very uncertain
of himself, need be annoyed by the characteristic
observation on the critical faculty, “there is <em>for the most
part</em> no such thing.”<a id='r1029'></a><a href='#f1029' class='c010'><sup>[1029]</sup></a>  For each of us may flatter himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>that he is the exception, and need have no doubt about the
rule. And, as a matter of fact, Schopenhauer proceeds to
show that there <em>is</em> a critical faculty, and that he knows very
well what it is, and that he has it. If he condemns comparison,
it is only what we have so often called the wrong comparison;
he lays the very strongest emphasis on the Golden
Rule of Criticism—that a poet, or any writer, is to be judged by
his best things. On the old subject of the value of immediate
and popular recognition, he is perhaps too interested a judge:
and there is also evident temper in his exhortation to critics
to “scourge mercilessly,” his doctrine that “Politeness in
criticism is injurious.” As the world goes, the critic who accepts
it as his first duty to scourge mercilessly, to neglect politeness,
is quite as likely to scourge the few good books as the many
bad, and will certainly do <em>himself</em> irreparable harm. So, also,
while recognising the nobility of much that Schopenhauer
has written on genius,<a id='r1030'></a><a href='#f1030' class='c010'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> we shall perhaps think that his
encomia on arrogance and his disapproval of modesty are
slightly unnecessary. Let us, at any rate, first light our largest
lantern, and go out in the brightest day our climate allows,
to find these modest men.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the æsthetic section,<a id='r1031'></a><a href='#f1031' class='c010'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> main and appended, of his great
book itself, Schopenhauer concerns us less. It may be quite
true<a id='r1032'></a><a href='#f1032' class='c010'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> that the subjective part of æsthetic pleasure
is delight in perceptive knowledge, independent
of Will; and the bass may be “the lowest grade of
the objectification” of the said Will. But according to the
views, perhaps wrongly but constantly maintained in this
book, positions of this kind have nothing to do with the
discovery or the defence of any concrete critical judgment
whatsoever. We find of course—as we must find in any man
of Schopenhauer’s powerful intellect and wide knowledge—divers
interesting <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, not always or often conditioned by
a tame consistency. Thus<a id='r1033'></a><a href='#f1033' class='c010'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> he dislikes rhyme altogether, but
sees, as not everybody since has seen, and as comparatively few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>had seen before him, the beauty of rhymed Mediæval Latin.
The passage on the sublimity of silence and solitude is an
extremely fine one: and if his general quarrel with the world
puts him in an unnecessary temper with minor poets,<a id='r1034'></a><a href='#f1034' class='c010'><sup>[1034]</sup></a> it is
interesting to compare his attack on them with Castelvetro’s.<a id='r1035'></a><a href='#f1035' class='c010'><sup>[1035]</sup></a>
It would be very interesting, too, to compare and connect his
views on Poetry with his very celebrated opinions on Love: but
<span lang="la"><i>non nostrum est</i></span>.<a id='r1036'></a><a href='#f1036' class='c010'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> And it is only when Schopenhauer touches
ethics that he is disputable; on æsthetic questions in the
applied sense he seldom goes wrong, and is always stimulating
and original to the highest degree.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.7'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Grillparzer.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Our “surprise” is the Austrian poet, Grillparzer.<a id='r1037'></a><a href='#f1037' class='c010'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> I am
told by persons who know more about that matter than I do,
that Grillparzer was a remarkable playwright; I am
sure that he is a remarkable critic. Four volumes
of his Works are devoted to this subject, and nearly the whole
of one of them<a id='r1038'></a><a href='#f1038' class='c010'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> is occupied by critical <span lang="fr"><i>pensées</i></span> and aphorisms
of the kind in which Joubert is the great master. Grillparzer
is not the equal of the Frenchman, nor has he the depth
of his countryman Novalis: but his critical matter is more
abundant than the latter’s, and it is of a rather more practical
kind. He seems, at all times of his long life, to have practised,
and he has explicitly, preached, what I myself believe to be
certainly the most excellent if not the only excellent way
of criticism. <a id='sec9.4.8'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>His motto in criticism.</i></span> The delivery unto Satan of all theory, which
I have put in the forefront of this Book, is of course
intentionally hyperbolical: yet what he puts in
the forefront of his own is quite sober. “My plan
in these annotations is, without any regard to system, to write
down on each subject what seems to me to flow out of its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>nature. The resultant contradictions will either finally clear
themselves away, or, being irremovable, will show me that
no system is possible.” I am by no means sure that this was
not the practice of Aristotle; it pretty certainly was that of
Longinus; I have endeavoured to show that, pursued as it
was by Dryden all through his literary life, it made him a
very great critic; and it was to no very small extent (though
in his case it was hampered and broken into by his fatal
inconsecutiveness) the method also of Coleridge. Grillparzer
had not the genius of these men: but he seems to have pursued
his own method faithfully for some fifty or sixty years,
and the result is some mediate axioms of very considerable
weight, and a large body of individual judgments which are
at least of interest.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.9'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>His results in aphorism,</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The former are perhaps the better. He has even attempts
at the definition of Beauty, which are as good as another’s,
holding that the Beautiful not merely gives satisfaction
and appeasement to the sensual part in
us, but also lifts up the soul.<a id='r1039'></a><a href='#f1039' class='c010'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> This, at least, escapes the
witty judgment of Burke quoted above, after Schlegel. He
has the combined boldness and good sense<a id='r1040'></a><a href='#f1040' class='c010'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> to see and say that
“Sense <em>is</em> prose”—to cry woe on the poetry that can be fully
explained by the understanding. He has dealt a swashing
blow<a id='r1041'></a><a href='#f1041' class='c010'><sup>[1041]</sup></a> at a terribly large part of ancient and modern criticism
in the words, “Pottering, [“Schlendrian,”] and Pedantry in
Art always delight in judging by Kinds—approving this
and denouncing that. But an open Art—sense knows no
Kinds: only individuals.” He is interesting and distinctly
original on Dilettanteism:<a id='r1042'></a><a href='#f1042' class='c010'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> stigmatises in women (I fear he
might have added not a few men) the “inability to admire
what you do not wholly approve,”<a id='r1043'></a><a href='#f1043' class='c010'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> and says plumply,<a id='r1044'></a><a href='#f1044' class='c010'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> <span lang="de"><i>Klassisch
ist fehlerfrei</i></span>, a proposition which begs the question as
little as any on a question that is always begged.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nearly all his aphorisms on poetry and prose blend neatness
and adequacy well, as this:<a id='r1045'></a><a href='#f1045' class='c010'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> “Prose and Poetry are like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>a journey and a walk. The object of the journey lies at its
end: of the walk, in the walking.” Nay, he is blunter still,
and to some people perhaps quite shocking, in comparing the
two to eating and drinking.<a id='r1046'></a><a href='#f1046' class='c010'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> A text for a weighty critical
sermon might, I think, be found in an aphorism of his,<a id='r1047'></a><a href='#f1047' class='c010'><sup>[1047]</sup></a> which
is not easy to translate into English without periphrasis: and
though he does not often venture upon the complicatedly
figurative, there is another<a id='r1048'></a><a href='#f1048' class='c010'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> about Islands which I wish Mr
Arnold had known, that he might have given us a pendant
to <cite>Isolation</cite>. In fact, in these meditations of his, Grillparzer,
though never pretentiously Delphic, is always for thoughts.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>and in individual judgment.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The very large body<a id='r1049'></a><a href='#f1049' class='c010'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> of individual judgments on literature,
ancient and modern, with which he supports these, and from
which, in part no doubt, he drew them, is, on the
whole though not wholly, a little inferior. But
we can see the reason for this inferiority where it
exists, and even then it does not make him worthless. He
has somewhat imperfect sympathies. On Shakespeare’s
Sonnets<a id='r1050'></a><a href='#f1050' class='c010'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> he is not much better than Hallam; his single
judgment on Heine,<a id='r1051'></a><a href='#f1051' class='c010'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> though studiously moderate, might
almost be called studiously inadequate: and in talking of
Friedrich Schlegel he cannot forget the author of <cite>Lucinde</cite>, or
that when they once met at Naples, the future mystic and
Neo-Catholic ate too much, drank too much, and talked too
greasily. This, considering that he himself can admire <cite>The
Custom of the Country</cite>, seems a little hard.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.11'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>A critic of limitations: but a critic.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Grillparzer is, in fact, one of those critics in exploring
whose region one gets to be familiar with certain
danger-signals which are not always signals of
danger only. As a practised playwright he speaks
with special interest on Shakespeare, and he has given us judgments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>on other dramatists, which have not less. His appreciation,
by no means indiscriminate, of Beaumont and Fletcher<a id='r1052'></a><a href='#f1052' class='c010'><sup>[1052]</sup></a>
is specially noteworthy, and he has a whole volume on the
Spanish Drama. I do not know whether any of our modern
Byron-worshippers are acquainted with his estimate<a id='r1053'></a><a href='#f1053' class='c010'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> of
their idol, whom he fully accepts as “the second greatest
English poet,” but of whom he gives an idea quite different
from the average Continental one. As a dramatist once more,
and a man with dramatic ideas, he is extremely hard on
Lessing;<a id='r1054'></a><a href='#f1054' class='c010'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> but I do not know an admiring critic of Goethe
who is much better<a id='r1055'></a><a href='#f1055' class='c010'><sup>[1055]</sup></a> on that difficult person. We know that
he will not appreciate Walther von der Vogelweide, though
he has no strong anti-mediæval prejudice as such; and he
does not.<a id='r1056'></a><a href='#f1056' class='c010'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> Finally, let me give, as remarkable, his coupling
of Adam Smith’s <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> and A. W. Schlegel’s
<cite>Lectures on Drama</cite> as “two of the most mischievous books of
modern times for an inexperienced understanding.” I am
not satisfied with his calling Tieck a “chattering noodle”
(“Fasler”), but at any rate he calls Gervinus “absurd.” He
returns again and again to the charge against this latter
egregious person, who is still quoted by the compilers of
Shakespeare Hand-books and the writers of examination
papers. If I had any need of pardoning (which I have not, since
I understand them) his remarks on Walther, on the Sonnets,
and on Heine, I would do it at once for the exclamation,
<span lang="de">“Du lieber Himmel!”</span> which he, a German, makes on
Gervinus’s most famous boast that “the English have left it
to us Germans to do full justice to their Shakespeare,” and
for his explosion at the methods by which “<span lang="de"><em>bis aufs Blut</em> wird
alles erklärt.”</span><a id='r1057'></a><a href='#f1057' class='c010'><sup>[1057]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In short, I strongly recommend Grillparzer, about whom I
have seen very little in English, to study at the hands of
those Englishmen who take an interest in criticism. A very
considerable man of letters himself, he seems to have never,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>in the course of his long life, lost interest in the work of
others. He had some natural limitations, and they appear
to have been further tightened by his playwrightship and by
the influence of Joseph Schreyvogel, a sort of Austrian Nisard,
of whom I do not know much.<a id='r1058'></a><a href='#f1058' class='c010'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> But the quotations and account
which I have given will, I think, show that he had
no small root of the critical matter in him, and that in more
than one or two instances he enunciated <em>and observed</em> critical
truths which are not exactly the stereotyped headings of the
critical copybook.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not necessary here, after what has been said repeatedly
before, to enter into any apology for not discussing the
abstract Æsthetic of the German nineteenth century. Even
Hegel, though he is tempting, must be omitted; for, as an
authority of unsuspected competence<a id='r1059'></a><a href='#f1059' class='c010'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> observes with some
naïveté on this very point, “it is undoubtedly difficult to get
a net result out of Hegel,” and it is with net results that we
are concerned. But a disciple of his may be usefully discussed
with reference to the more general sides of the matter.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Carrière: his</i> Æsthetik.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="de"><cite>Æsthetik</cite></span><a id='r1060'></a><a href='#f1060' class='c010'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> of Moritz Carrière is a sort of object-lesson on
its subject. The praises which have been bestowed on its style
are quite justified: there is no German book of the
kind known to me that is pleasanter to read. Its
learning and its arrangement are all that can be
desired. And yet, as one reads it, the old reflections on <cite>The
Elements of Criticism</cite> arise (with a difference of course) once
more. The impressions produced are rather those of a long
course of elegant sermons, with æsthetic substituted for
theology, than of anything else. Here you may read that
women are smaller than men; that “as the noses of children
are small and stumpy, a <span lang="fr"><i>retroussé</i></span> nose in the adult indicates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>want of development, though with elegant culture [of the
feature or the person?] it may be naïve and roguish”; that
dilettanti are always plagiarists. The conclusion of the second
volume, to the extent of nearly two hundred pages, is devoted
to Poetry, and is very good reading. Sometimes whole pages
are neatly woven of agreeable poetical citations, or of dicta
from more or less important persons,—“Schiller says,” “Goethe
observes,” and so on. We learn further how Music “presents
the idea as the principle and measure of the movement of life,
and connects the beauty of that which is to come with that of
what is”—like, say, a dinner-bell when one is talking to an
agreeable person in a pretty drawing-room. Observe that Herr
Carrière is neither quack nor twaddler; he does really feel the
beauties about which he is talking. Such a passage as that at
the foot of p. 457, vol. ii., and the top of the next, on Homer’s
method of bringing scenes and figures before us, is real criticism
of a valuable kind,—not more, it is true, than a corollary
of Lessing’s propositions, but worth adding to them, for all that.
I know hardly anything more shrewdly and amusingly adjusted,
as a sort of æstheticised “Rhetoric” of the Hermogenean type,
than the remarks and illustrations about Figures, from that of
the orator who said, “Let us burn our ships and launch out
boldly into the open sea,” onwards. The attempts to connect
different metres with distinctive mental effects, or with separate
classes of subject, are again most ingenious. His defence of the
rhymes of the <span lang="de"><cite>Nibelungenlied</cite></span> against the characteristic criticism
of Gervinus is admirable. In fact, the book is almost everywhere,
as Mr Weller would say, “wery pretty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Only—as we have so often been constrained to add in dealing
with critics, from the Greek Rhetoricians downwards—how
much better employed would this erudition, this taste, this
ingenious adjustment of exposition to example, have been upon
individual and complete poems, books, writers! These pieces,
these selected examples, are after all only branches torn from
the living trunk, mutilated things, wanting their context almost
always to give them full beauty and their own beauty. But
this is not the worst: for at least on the doctrine of the Poetic
Moment they will sometimes give that moment. But they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>produced, not to give it but to exemplify a presumed classification
and analysis of the manner of its giving. They have to
yield a formula: and insensibly, inevitably, the heresy will
grow upon the reader, that the formula will yield <em>them</em>. It is
as if some diabolical physiologist took Helen from the arms
of Paris or of Faustus, extracted her eyes, or tore off her hair,
or drew ounces of the half-divine blood from her veins, dissected
and analysed them, and said, “Gentlemen, this dissection
reconstituted, this analysis ‘made up,’ will give you what is
required to make you immortal.” But, alas! it will not. And
the fact is, that <em>no</em> explanation of the manner in which the
literary delight is produced is ever general or true of any but
the individual instance. That delight is never the same twice
running: these stars always have some, it may be infinitesimal,
but discernible and individualising, glory. Yet Herr Carrière
is a craftsmanlike and entertaining demonstrator of the Undemonstrable.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Later German Shakespeare-critics.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The performances of the later German Shakespeare-critics
are so much better known in England than almost any other
part of the literature of the subject that it seems
unnecessary to devote much of our rapidly disappearing
space to them. Gervinus, Delius, Ulrici,
Elze, have all been translated, quoted, and so forth,
with the curious deference to foreign opinion in matters of
taste, which has so oddly accompanied English stiff-neckedness
in general. <a id='sec9.4.14'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Gervinus: his</i> German Poetry.</span> I am bound to say that I think not much of
any of these pundits;<a id='r1061'></a><a href='#f1061' class='c010'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> and least of all of their
great Panjandrum Gervinus. His critical quality,
however, may be for our purpose better gauged
by taking his large work on German Poetry.<a id='r1062'></a><a href='#f1062' class='c010'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> It is an estimable
book enough; the author often says what he ought to
have said, and does not very often or very outrageously say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>what he should not. But the faults of his Shakespeare-criticism—platitude,
verbiage, attention to the unnecessary, and
avoidance of the heart and root of the matter, the quality
of Shakespeare as an English poet, mark this also. Take
persons most diverse in character, time, what you will—take
Walther von der Vogelweide, Hans Sachs, Opitz, Novalis, for
instance—and read his verdicts on them. You will find that
in the first place he hardly ever quotes or appreciates a <em>phrase</em>—in
itself a tell-tale, and damagingly tell-tale, abstinence. But
you will also find, in compensation for this reticence, a flood of
general remark, (false) comparison, see-saw antithesis, and the
like. By no means his worst judgment, but a most characteristic
one, is that on Bürger, which I may partly translate, partly
summarise, from the original:<a id='r1063'></a><a href='#f1063' class='c010'><sup>[1063]</sup></a>—</p>

<a id='sec9.4.15'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>On Bürger.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“Bürger then appears to us as at once a pathological and a
critical poet, a poet of Nature and of Art, a poet of the people
and of Love. He belongs at once to the school of
the North and to that of the South, relies at once
on sensations and reflections. His nature-painting is apparently
dashed on with a big brush, but it is careful in detail.
There is in him a fight of the Universal and the Particular, of
Art and Nature, of Endowment and Facility, of Poetry and
Platitude.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not know how many readers will sympathise with, or
even understand, the kind of rage which, I confess it, such
criticism as this excites in my mind. It is not exactly false
criticism; on the contrary, it is rather true. But its truth has
nothing vital, nothing germinal, nothing specially appropriate
to the subject in it: and if there can be said to be anything
specially appropriate to the writer, it is only matter for an
unfavourable judgment of him. Any man, with a good deal
of reading and a little practice, can string tic-tac antitheses of
this kind, made up of critical commonplaces and terminology,
together for pages. No man, from anything of the kind, could
grasp the real <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span> of Bürger—the fact that he was one of
the first to make, in poetry, an almost convulsive attempt to
get out of the conventional by attempting the supernatural.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>In all these German Shakespeare-critics, moreover, the fault
(which we have noticed even in Goethe) reappears, that they
are criticising, not Shakespeare, but the translation of Shakespeare;
that while they have plenty to say about the plot, and
the “points in Hamlet’s soul,” and even sometimes the text
in its lower aspects, the other and over-soul, the essence, the
poetry, of Shakespeare not merely escapes, but apparently fails
to interest or occupy them at all. On the accidents, the unnecessary
things, they are voluble. “The rest is silence”—to
expand which text in its present bearing were an insult.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.16'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The Shakespeare-heretics: Rümelin.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A word or two, however, may be given to the arch-heretic
in this division—the interesting Herr Rümelin.<a id='r1064'></a><a href='#f1064' class='c010'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> I find, in relation
to this subject, a MS. note, of no matter what
author, which may deserve quotation, despite the
impropriety of its phraseology: “<span lang="la"><cite>Asinus Rumelinus</cite></span>.
Asinity much invited by precedent asinity on the
other side.” And really there is something in this. It is not
merely that Herr Rümelin’s essay sets forth his thoughts as
those <span lang="de"><i>eines Realisten</i></span>, and thus declares its author a reactionary
partisan against Idealism and Romanticism. By a quaint, but
not uncommon, “suck of the current” he has adopted not a
few of the fallacies of the school he combats. It is <em>their</em>
Shakespeare, not the Shakespeare of Shakespeare and eternity,
that he is belittling. We have seen how a sensible German like
Grillparzer treated Gervinus’s boast about Germany as Shakespeare’s
prophet. Rümelin’s demonstration that Shakespeare
was forgotten in England for 150 years is only this same boast
altered a little. It is, as every child ought to know now, and
as I shall not here waste time in proving, an absolute falsehood:
but it could be of no importance to the true critic if
it were true. Gold scarcely ceases to be gold during the time
that it is, or because it is, <span lang="la"><i>irrepertum</i></span>: and perhaps the only
thing that retains the slightest interest in this part of Herr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>Rümelin’s examination is his use of the argument that Bacon
does not mention Shakespeare—a fertile source since of the
finest mare’s-nests. But the Essay is a really interesting one,
and might have done—though I do not know that it has done—much
good to the chatterers about Shakespeare. The Southampton
chatter, the chatter about the greatness of the Elizabethan
period in connection with politics, &#38;c., the chatter of
Gervinus, the chatter of the Romantics—against all these
Rümelin directs an anti-criticism, easy enough and sometimes
not ineffective. As a Realist he does not (we can easily see why)
like the character-play. As a Preceptist, he holds that Tragedy
must not individualise, and that scarcely one of Shakespeare’s
dramas contains a <span lang="de"><i>wohlgefügte pragmatische denkbare Handlung</i></span>.
As a mid-nineteenth century Liberal he is pained to find that
Shakespeare was a Royalist and an aristocrat of the purest
water. Comparing Shakespeare and Goethe (for there is much
mere Chauvinism in Rümelin), he finds that the one “flashes
on things like a rocket or a blue light,” while the other “shows
them in a clear mirror.” But after all he admits “the joy in
the poet.” So perhaps this poor heretic was not quite so far
from the Kingdom of Heaven as Gervinus and Ulrici, for in
reading them you are seldom invited to consider “the joy in
the poet”—the Poetic Moment—at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>We may conclude this chapter with notices of three later
German critics, who are, in different ways, interesting and
characteristic—the novelist Freytag; the cosmopolitan polygrapher,
Karl Hillebrand; and the greatest, if the maddest,
man of letters of modern Germany—Nietzsche.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.17'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Freytag.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>For the first, Gustav Freytag’s <span lang="de"><cite>Technik des Dramas</cite></span><a id='r1065'></a><a href='#f1065' class='c010'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> could
hardly lack mention here as the principal contribution to criticism
of the chief novelist of Germany during the
later nineteenth century, and as itself one of the
main contributions to a division of our subject which comes
direct from one of the main fountainheads, the <cite>Poetics</cite> of Aristotle.
Freytag, however,—and the explicitness of his title bars
any complaint on the subject,—occupies himself almost wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>with the <em>theatrical</em> side of the matter—such questions as that
of verse or prose and the like being relegated to the close,
and very briefly handled.  Had he written three hundred years
earlier we should have had more room for him.  As it is, the
chief thing noticeable, and that not favourably, is his adoption
of that Goethean utilitarianism which we have stigmatised
before.  He says nothing, he tells us, about French classical
drama or the drama of Spain, because “we have nothing more
to learn and nothing to fear from them.”  That, it need scarcely
be said, is complete heresy according to the view of criticism
maintained in this book.  What you have to “fear” hardly
in any case matters; and you have always something to learn.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.18'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Hillebrand and cosmopolitan Criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Karl, or, as he sometimes called himself, Carl, Hillebrand is
an interesting figure, and withal a typical one.  He invented, I
think, a useful word—“xenomania” or <span lang="de"><cite>Fremdensucht</cite></span>—which
was very proper for the nineteenth century:
he attracted the notice, in his own country, of such
a formidable and considerable person as the young
Nietzsche; he wrote in several languages and lived in more
countries, especially England and Italy.  There was a time,
which I can remember very well, when he “seemed to be a
pillar.”  But I am not so sure that he was one.  He prided
himself on his cosmopolitanism: and one of his best-known
pieces, addressed to the editor of <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite> and
reprinted in the great collection of his miscellaneous works,
entitled <span lang="de"><cite>Zeiten Völker und Menschen</cite></span>,<a id='r1066'></a><a href='#f1066' class='c010'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> deals with the presence
of <span lang="de"><i>Fremdensucht</i></span> and insularity combined in Englishmen.  We
were, thought Herr Hillebrand some twenty or five-and-twenty
years since, interesting ourselves in Continental matters at last,
but we were not doing it in the right way.  Frenchmen thought
we interested ourselves too promiscuously in their men and
matters; so did Germans.  We put [<em>did</em> we?] Mérimée and
Octave Feuillet on a level; Rachel and Madame Sarah Bernhardt.
We distressed Herr Hillebrand’s cosmopolitanism and
his particularism equally.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>This is a sufficiently interesting and distinct point of view
to have a few words here, especially as it has been often taken
since. I venture to disagree with it <span lang="la"><i>in toto</i></span>. It is very well,
if your sight is weak, to have the best spectacles adjusted to
it that art can adjust. But you will very seldom better your
sight by taking somebody else’s spectacles; and if you borrow
the spectacles of several other people and combine or frequently
substitute them, you will very soon see “men as trees walking.”
To the process of having spectacles made for yourself corresponds
that of studying foreign literatures as widely as possible
and as carefully as possible; the process of adopting
French points of view of Frenchmen, German of Germans,
and the like, answers, I think, to the other. There is a wrong
interpretation of <span lang="la"><i>Sportam nactus es</i></span>, but also a right. And I
think Herr Hillebrand’s own results bear out what I have
said. His critical work is very extensive; it had much, and
still has some, interest. It is the work of a man of certainly
more than average cleverness and of much more than average
information; of a man with a really fair knowledge of literature
and more than a fair knowledge of institutions,
customs, national <span lang="la"><i>mores</i></span> generally. Herr Hillebrand would
never have made some, or many, of the little slips at which
we laugh so much in other people, and at which other people
laugh in us. But his cosmopolitanism, I think, eviscerated
and emasculated his genius. In re-reading essays of his
which I have read before, I have found them faded, tame,
“fushionless”; in reading others for the first time they produce
the same effect without the contrast. The satirist was
justified in making fun of the “temptations To belong to other
nations”; but, in a sense of which Mr Gilbert was not thinking,
and of which I doubt his making fun, it <em>is</em> to credit and
to advantage that an Englishman shall remain an Englishman,
a German a German, and so forth. There is a moral in the
story of Antæus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not that there is not in Hillebrand work still interesting
(though it is usually rather too contemporary as well as too
cosmopolitan) when he is dealing with Fielding and Sterne and
Milton, and Machiavelli and Rabelais and Tasso, as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>when he is dealing with Doudan and Renan and Taine. He
was for an age: but for rather a short one. And one of his
papers is an awful example. It is entitled <span lang="la"><cite>Delirium Tremens</cite></span>,
and it characterises the work with which it deals as a “distressing
aberration.” That work is analysed with considerable
skill, and the article contains some shrewd remarks, notably
one on the invariable tendency towards “charcoal-burner”
faith of some kind even in the most free-thinking Frenchman.
Hillebrand’s strength lay in things of this kind. But the
instance shows where his strength did not lie, and that this
was in the direction of literary criticism. For this “distressing
aberration,” this effect of <span lang="la"><i>delirium tremens</i></span>, is one of the capital
imaginative works of the later nineteenth century—the <span lang="fr"><cite>Tentation
de Saint-Antoine</cite></span> of Gustave Flaubert.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.19'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Nietzsche.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Nietzsche’s criticism<a id='r1067'></a><a href='#f1067' class='c010'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> is, on the one hand, very much what
might be expected by any one who might have managed (it
would be difficult) to read only that part of his
work which does not contain it, and on the other
throws a very useful amount of additional light on his general
mental attitude. Himself a remarkable artist from the purely
literary side—the best modern German prose-writer by far,
with Heine and Schopenhauer—he cannot help paying literary
art the same compliment which he pays to some other things,
that, not exactly of believing and trembling, but of acknowledging
as he blasphemes. He blasphemes, of course, pretty freely:
take away blasphemy, parody, and that particular kind of
borrowing which thinks to disguise itself by inserting or extracting
“nots,” and there is not much of Nietzsche left but
form. <a id='sec9.4.20'></a><span class='sni side9'>Zarathustra, <i>the</i> Birth of Tragedy, <i>and</i> Der Fall Wagner.</span> The mere headings of <span lang="de"><cite>Also Sprach Zarathustra</cite></span> will
guide the laziest to his ultimate opinions upon poetry and
other things. At the beginning, the <cite>Birth of Tragedy</cite> (1871)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>is, despite its title, hardly literary at all; its theory of an
orgiastic hyperanthropic Dionysus-cult superseding
the calm “Apollonian” Epic, and itself superseded
by the corrupting philosophy of Socrates, being
entirely philosophic (or philo<em>moric</em>).  Later, the onslaught
on Wagner is very literary, and consists, in fact,
of a violent—of a frantic—protest against the tendencies of
Romanticism, of which he quite correctly sees that Wagner is,
with whatever differences, a musical exponent, and against
“literary” music itself.  Perhaps there never was a hostile
contention which the other side could accept with such alacrity
as Nietzsche’s approximation<a id='r1068'></a><a href='#f1068' class='c010'><sup>[1068]</sup></a>of Wagner and Victor Hugo.
They <em>are</em> extremely alike in merits as in faults, and the recognition
of the twinship is a point in favour of Nietzsche’s
critical power, whatever his dislike of it may be.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.21'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><span lang="de">Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>To attend more heedfully to chronological order—the four
remarkable essays of the <span lang="de"><cite>Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen</cite></span>, which,
early as they are (1873-76), are perhaps the last
things in which Nietzsche displayed himself as
entirely <span lang="la"><i>compos mentis</i></span>, are close to our subject
throughout,<a id='r1069'></a><a href='#f1069' class='c010'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> and not seldom openly deal with it.
The tremendous castigation administered to the “Culture-Philistinism”
of Strauss—a document very fit to be registered
as an abiding corrective to the hymns of our German-praisers,
from Mr. Arnold to Mr. Haldane, and all who shall
follow—is sometimes directly, and always in spirit, literary-critical.
The unfriendly attitude of the next paper to the
Study of History may seem less so, for, as we have seen, literary
criticism without literary history is almost hopeless.  But here
Nietzsche’s as yet unformulated, but certainly conceived, aspirations
towards a future that was to be quite different from the
past, probably come in, and he was entitled to regard with
suspicion, and to meet with protest, the “dry-as-dust” character
of German history-study.  The enthusiastic encomia on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>Schopenhauer and Wagner are again as constantly literary in
character as the subsequent denials of both.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.22'></a><div class='sidenote side9'>La Gaya Scienza.</div>

<p class='c001'>If the similarity of title in Nietzsche’s <span lang="it"><cite>La Gaya Scienza</cite></span>
(<span lang="de">“Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft”</span>) and in Mr Dallas’s above-mentioned
book should awake expectations of criticism
in anybody, he will be at first grievously
disappointed, for, except an anticipation of a later fling at
Seneca,<a id='r1070'></a><a href='#f1070' class='c010'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> he will, for a long time, find nothing at all of the
kind. But he will make a very great mistake if he throws
the book aside. The aphoristic manner, or rather the manner
of detached notes, like Ben Jonson’s in the <cite>Discoveries</cite>, which
Nietzsche had now adopted, makes it unsafe to conclude from
any one page, or even from a considerable sequence of pages,
what will meet us when we turn the next. In the middle,
and again towards the end, we come upon “pockets” of our
ore. From § 82 onwards, on the opposition of <span lang="fr"><i>esprit</i></span> to the
Greek temper, on translation, on the origin of Poetry, we find
many noteworthy things, leading up to a formal note on “Prose
and Poetry,” wherein is the selection of Leopardi, Mérimée,
Emerson, and Landor as the prose masters of the nineteenth
century proper. Here Mérimée’s scorn and Landor’s pride may
have had something to do with Nietzsche’s admiration: but
they cannot be said to usurp their places. I am not Italian
scholar enough to give an opinion on Leopardi’s claim.
Emerson, some may think, while not denying his merits, “a
little over-parted.” I should venture to substitute Schopenhauer,
if not Nietzsche himself.<a id='r1071'></a><a href='#f1071' class='c010'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> And after this we at last
come on the long missing passage on Shakespeare, only to find,
as perhaps some may have been very well prepared to find,
that Shakespeare is not treated as a poet at all, but as the
author of <cite>Hamlet</cite> and the creator of—Brutus! Nietzsche, as
most people should know, had a great idea of the Romans,
thought them <span lang="de"><i>vornehm</i></span>, and the nearest approaches in history
to the <span lang="de"><i>Uebermensch</i></span>; but his special selection of Brutus is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>very curious, though fortunately out of our range. The other
pocket of the book comes long afterwards, and quite toward
the end, where we get interesting things on modern German
philosophers, “learned books and literature,” and the all-important
question, <span lang="de">“Was ist Romantik?”</span> Here, however,
Nietzsche goes off on Apollo and Dionysus as of old.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.23'></a><div class='sidenote side7'>Jenseits von Gut und Böse, <i>&#38;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The late and already somewhat half-sane <span lang="de"><cite>Jenseits von Gut
und Böse</cite></span>, with its still later and still more fatally symptomatic
continuation the <span lang="de"><cite>Genealogie der Moral</cite></span> (1887), devotes
itself mainly to non-literary exercises of Nietzsche’s
general topsyturvyfication.<a id='r1072'></a><a href='#f1072' class='c010'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> But there are passages
which at any rate come close to literature. Such are the
curious remarks on Galiani, Aristophanes, Petronius, together
with some on Plato and Lessing, in §§ 26-28 of <span lang="de"><cite>Jenseits</cite></span>; those
on certain Germans of the great age, from Goethe himself
downwards, in § 247; very specially those on German style
and speech, in § 250; and the quaint attack on English philosophy
in § 255. It may be not improperly observed here, in
connection with Nietzsche’s Anglophobia, that besides what
was, as in the case of <span lang="de">“der Alte Zauberer”</span> (Wagner), a sufficient
cause of hate, the fact that he had once been rather
directed by and indebted to English thinkers,<a id='r1073'></a><a href='#f1073' class='c010'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> there were
others. He paid us the compliment of believing England to
be the European stronghold of Christianity and Morality, and
seems to have known very little directly about us.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.24'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><span lang="de">Götzen-Dämmerung.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>The great critical “place” in Nietzsche, however, as far
as I have read him (for I have not yet had time to explore the
“rubbish-heaps raked together by abject adorers,” as a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>competent authority once described them to me, of the <span lang="de"><cite>Nachgelassene
Werke</cite></span>) is the <span lang="de"><cite>Götzen-Dämmerung</cite></span> (1889), his
last publication before the prison-house closed. Nowhere
is the Ishmaelite character, which reveals
itself pathetically in the <span lang="de"><cite>Zarathustra</cite></span>, so petulantly present.
The very first paragraph batches together as <span lang="de">“Meine Unmöglichen,”</span>
with a scornful tag to each tail, Seneca, Rousseau,
Schiller, Dante, Kant, Hugo, Liszt, George Sand, Michelet,
Carlyle, Mill, the Goncourts, and Zola—a somewhat heterogeneous
company who receive some recruits in the amplifications
of their judgments that follow. A hasty judge, who
could not apply the system of ruthless toleration which has
been applied in this book, might of course disable Nietzsche
altogether on some of them. To say that Dante is “a hyena
who makes poetry in graves” is, <span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, no more
and no less critical than to say that Nietzsche is a Bedlamite
who sets his Bedlam on fire and sings and dances on the
blazing walls. Here the source of uncritical blindness is
obvious: and the explanation is renewed in the cases of Mill,
George Sand, and one of the later additions, Renan. But the
objection to Mill’s “<em>offensive</em> clearness,”<a id='r1074'></a><a href='#f1074' class='c010'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> to George Sand as
“the milch-cow of beautiful style,” to Renan’s “nerve-dissolvingness,”<a id='r1075'></a><a href='#f1075' class='c010'><sup>[1075]</sup></a>
are really literary objections, and, as some may
think, not unjust ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very interesting is his intense hatred of Sainte-Beuve for
his “femininity,” his Romanticism (which Nietzsche does not,
like some people, mistake), and (as he lets us see, with his
usual naïveté) his critical power. His wrath with George Eliot
for trying to retain Christian morality, after giving up
Christian faith, is less literary. But, on the whole, Nietzsche’s
criticism, such as it is, hangs very well together and is characteristic
enough, even where it may seem, inconsistent. It has
the special bents of the lover of <span lang="de"><cite>Rausch</cite></span>, of the anti-crusader
to whom, not as in the case of his much-admired Beyle,<a id='r1076'></a><a href='#f1076' class='c010'><sup>[1076]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>Christian Hell, but the Christian Heaven, is something that
leaves him no peace or patience, with the general drift which
we have seen in German criticism, to fix on extra-literary
points. A whole study might be made of his attitude to
Goethe, whom he welcomes, salutes, almost adores as a fellow
anti-crusader, as an example of <span lang="de"><i>vornehm</i></span> selfishness and unsentiment,
while he is never tired of bringing in some of
Goethe’s greatest things, notably the ends of both parts of
<cite>Faust</cite>, for his favourite end-of-the-nineteenth-century trick of
parody-reversal.</p>

<a id='sec9.4.25'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>His general critical position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, therefore, we may call Nietzsche a contributor
of extraordinarily interesting things to our history, and in some
ways a  literary critic <span lang="la"><i>in potentia</i></span>, such as Germany
has hardly given us save in the case of Novalis.
But here, as elsewhere, his gifts of potency were
marred by the <em>impotency</em>, the reckless, uncontrolled, uncontrollable
flux and reflux of mood and temper, which distinguished
him ever more and more. We have not required—we have
seen that it is ridiculous to require—a rigid consistency, a
development only in one straight line, from the critic. He
may, he must, learn, branch out, even sometimes retrace his
steps in a moderate degree. But when we find, with but a
few years between the judgments, of Schopenhauer, that he is
“a great educator,” a sort of intellectual Joshua to the German
Israel, and that he is a “common smasher or debaser of the
currency”;<a id='r1077'></a><a href='#f1077' class='c010'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> of Wagner that he is a hierophant, a master of
masters, the “Alexander Magnus” of music, and that he
is an “old sorcerer,” a “modern Cagliostro,” a “seducer and
poisoner of Art,” we can but shake our heads. No man can
go through such revolutions as these and remain a critic, if he
ever was one. That in some ways Criticism has seen no nobler
mind, no stronger or keener faculty, overthrown and lost to her,
is, I think, true enough: but of the overthrow and the loss I
can entertain no doubt.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1069'>1069</a>. I was pleased, in reading Nietzsche,
after I had written the section above
on Grillparzer, and when I had already

him frequently quoting the Austrian

selecting the other as the representative
German critic of his time.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1071'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1071'>1071</a>. It would be improper to dwell on

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1072'>1072</a>. This word has been objected to by
precisians. But it has the authority
of Thackeray: and if it had none, it is
exactly the word wanted for a certain
flagrant quality of the latest nineteenth
century, and more especially for
the <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span> of Nietzsche. With all his
originality in form, he is simply parasitic
in fact. He can only deny and
pervert and “topsyturvify” the established
and accepted. The <span lang="de"><i>Uebermensch</i></span>
himself is much more an “<span lang="de"><em>Un</em>mensch</span>,”
who is not to be God but an
un-God. And the philosopher’s famous
syllogism, “There cannot be a God,
or why am <em>I</em> not one if there is?”
amounts simply to a turning topsyturvy
of the much sounder and in fact unanswerable

<div class='c016'></div>
<a id='sec9.5.1'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Limitations of this chapter.</i></div>
<p class='c025'>Something apologetic has to be said, also, in regard to this
present chapter. It is confessedly inadequate as a History, in
each individual case, of the critical performances of
European countries, other than England, France, and
Germany; it is perhaps not so inadequate as a
constituent of the present work. That the writer does not
pretend to any such acquaintance with these performances
as he may, he believes, claim with the others, may seem
a rather damning plea: yet perhaps it is not so. For it is
for the other side to show that such acquaintance was necessarily
incumbent on him, and that, not possessing it, he was
bound to postpone the setting forth of what he had to say
until the acquisition was accomplished. I acknowledge that I
am not of this opinion. In some cases, as we shall see, the
critical achievements now under consideration are almost demonstrably
unimportant to the general history of Criticism as
yet: and in all it may, I think, be fairly contended that they
are for the present negligible. For the present, no doubt, only.
There probably will come a time when such a new-comer as
Russian will extend to European criticism the influence which
it has already begun to exercise on European literature, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>when older literatures, like Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and the
Scandinavian varieties, will reassert, or assert for the first time,
their position. But they have hardly done so yet, save in the
case of those who, like Dr Brandes, are not of our competence,
as living.</p>

<a id='sec9.5.2'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Spain.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The most remarkable of the confessions of this with which I
am acquainted is given by the part relating to our present subject,
of that work, so freely used, and so necessarily
praised, in the last volume, the <span lang="es"><cite>Historia de las ideas
estéticas en España</cite></span> of Señor Menéndez y Pelayo. This consists
of three substantial volumes, or about a third of the whole work.
Yet it is hardly too much to say that it is solely concerned
with æsthetic ideas <em>out of</em> Spain—that it is an account of the
general course of European, not of the particular course of
Spanish, criticism. The foreigner and the general historian
can hardly be blamed for not attempting what the native and
the specialist declines. If, indeed, we were concerned with
living writers, Señor Menéndez himself and others would give
us most satisfactory occupation: but we are not.</p>

<a id='sec9.5.3'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Italy.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The case of Italy is rather different. Here also there are notable
critical names with which our scheme precludes us from dealing,
but here native enterprise has not “confessed
and avoided.” I do not know anything, in any other
language, like the very remarkable <span lang="it"><cite>Antologia della Nostra
Critica Moderna</cite></span> of Signor Luigi Morandi:<a id='r1078'></a><a href='#f1078' class='c010'><sup>[1078]</sup></a> and I certainly do
not know of any such testimony to the existing critical interests
of another country as the fact that sixteen editions of it appear
to have been sold in little more than as many years. Yet this
very book justifies our refusal. Signor Morandi has not hesitated
to “throw back,” not merely to Manzoni, who was born
fifteen years within the eighteenth century, but even to Baretti,
whose whole life was comprised therein, and who was born in the
year in which Addison died. Yet by far the larger number
of his contributors are living. They have already done much
to make good the claim of their country, if not to that pride of
critical place which she held in the sixteenth century, at any
rate to a place far higher than she could claim in the seventeenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>and eighteenth: and they are likely to go farther yet.
For Italy, never quite neglectful of the glories of her older
literature, has of late turned to their study with a will; and
in this turning, as we have seen, lies the one and certain way
to a critical Renaissance.<a id='r1079'></a><a href='#f1079' class='c010'><sup>[1079]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.5.4'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>De Sanctis.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We must, however, give some special mention to one writer
who is very remarkable in himself, and who is generally admitted
to have been, as far as in one man lay, the
author, or at least encourager, and guide of this
renewed attention to criticism in Italy. Francesco de Sanctis
is undoubtedly a very interesting person. To us his interest
does not lie—to the same extent as it may to others—in the
coincidence of his time and his efforts with the new struggle
for, and attainment of, political unity: but we can cheerfully
allow a place for this. Italy wanted to do for and by herself,
in criticism as elsewhere, and he came to show her how so
to do. But from our point of view his critical character is
interesting somewhat differently, and somewhat differently
explicable. He obviously, like Mr Arnold in England, like
others elsewhere, was determined towards criticism by the
influence of the French Romantics, especially Sainte-Beuve.
But he blended with the general characteristics of this criticism
not so much Mr Arnold’s specially literary devotion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>the greater gods of ancient and modern times, not so much
Sainte-Beuve’s own irresistible attraction to the character,
the manners, and so forth of his subjects—as
the old Italian addiction, already revived and redirected by
Vico, towards philosophising. <a id='sec9.5.5'></a><span class='sni side7'><i>Character of his work.</i></span> In the first Essay of his most
famous, influential, and characteristic book<a id='r1080'></a><a href='#f1080' class='c010'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> he cannot write
more than a few lines without flinging his disciple neck and
heels into the ocean with the question, as a chief one of Literature,
“What is the destiny of the human generations?” A
momentous question certainly: but one which concerns literature
only as it concerns everything else from theology to
therapeutics, and perhaps a little less than it concerns most
of them. But this opens the old truceless war, and we must
turn away from it. Let me only suggest that De Sanctis is
a little unfair to the ancients when he says in the same essay
that “the sense of Life begins to reveal itself in Shakespeare.”
Many a dialogue and many a chorus, many an oration and
many a historic passage, will rise up in judgment against him
for this, at the great day of critical account.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must not, however, be too severe on him; for a certain
southern tendency to hyperbole is not one of his least engaging
characteristics. He shows himself of the nineteenth-century
in general, and of the tribe of Sainte-Beuve in particular, by
being almost nothing if not an essayist. They complain of
his <cite>History of Italian Literature</cite> that, good as it is, it is too
much of a bundle of Essays; his two best-known works, <span lang="it"><cite>Saggi
Critici</cite></span><a id='r1081'></a><a href='#f1081' class='c010'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> and <span lang="it"><cite>Nuovi Saggi</cite></span>,<a id='r1082'></a><a href='#f1082' class='c010'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> do not pretend to be anything else.
The latter is chiefly devoted to Italian subjects, for De Sanctis
was deeply imbued with a generous cult of his own noble
literature, which is one of the best features of the Italians.
The <span lang="it"><cite>Saggi Critici</cite></span> is more miscellaneous, and so more representative.
I do not know his work quite exhaustively enough to
be certain how much he knew of English; but it is rather
noteworthy that in dealing with Beatrice Cenci his reference
to Shelley is exceedingly slight, and might almost be called
perfunctory. On the other hand, he has an interesting (first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>hand?) comparison between “Machbet” and Wallenstein. But
French literature, and especially contemporary French literature,
seems to have interested him most. He has a very
vigorous and successful defence of Hugo’s Triboulet against
Saint-Marc Girardin, and what seems to me the best, and the
most characteristic, of all his essays is one on the <cite>Contemplations</cite>,
where two distinct and rather opposite currents of
thought and sentiment clash and ripple in the most refreshing
manner. Nowhere is there a better example of that
generous hyperbolical rhetoric which has been glanced at:
no one has given a more amiable exhibition of that <span lang="fr"><i>petite
fièvre cérébrale</i></span> which has been noticed more than once, and
which the great Frenchman excites in all fit minds. But
while the critical De Sanctis applauds and revels, the philosophical
De Sanctis has qualms. Is not (here we have an
echo of Planche) Hugo’s art more musical than poetical?
Poetry must have “a clear silver” sound. No sound can give
you any idea: where we have Mr John Morley’s sad heresy
about the “vernal wood” anticipated. So once more the
<span lang="fr"><i>besoin de philosopher</i></span> did a little spoil De Sanctis, and has
continued, let us say, not quite to improve his countrymen
and disciples. But he did a great, an effectual, and to this
day an enduring and admirable work: and even Italy, high
as is the standard which she has set her children, is justified
also of this her child.</p>

<a id='sec9.5.6'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Switzerland.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The accounts which I could give of nineteenth-century criticism
in most other nations would be second-hand, would have
to be meagre, and, for the reasons just given, as
well as others to be added at the end of this chapter,
would be almost superfluous; but there is one—the smallest
of all—which cannot be quite passed by. Switzerland, from
geographical situation and linguistic and racial circumstance,
has always been exposed to whatever literary influences were
felt in each and all of her three great neighbours: and her
contributions to the literature of Europe, stimulated thereby,
have always been more than respectable. We have somewhat
unceremoniously classed not a few of the authors of these
contributions according to language rather than to strict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>nationality. But the literary activity of the Swiss—chiefly
in French, but <em>as</em> Swiss—has been particularly great and
particularly critical during the nineteenth century: and we
may give some space to two<a id='r1083'></a><a href='#f1083' class='c010'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> famous examples of it, one in
the earlier, one in the later, division of the period—to Vinet

his half-century. But from a very early age he was
a teacher of literature, and though he devoted part

was always, in a manner, a critic in his heart. His <span lang="fr"><cite>Chrestomathie

of Eighteenth Century French Literature</cite><a id='r1085'></a><a href='#f1085' class='c010'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> is, and will remain,
a minor Classic. But perhaps no book of his affords better
occasion for criticising his criticism than the posthumous
collection of his <i>Études sur la Littérature Française au Xix<sup>ème</sup>
Siècle</i>.<a id='r1086'></a><a href='#f1086' class='c010'><sup>[1086]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.5.8'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Sainte-Beuve on him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Vinet was (to give a choice of metaphors) dubbed Knight-Critic,
or admitted of the Academy of Universal Criticism, at
the hands of Sainte-Beuve himself—the Grandmaster
of Order and Academy alike—in an article
written in 1837, and at present contained in the
first thirty pages or so of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Portraits Contemporains</cite></span>, vol. iii.
It is written in a more patronising tone, with more meticulousness
of detail, and with less easy mastery of method, than it
would have been as a <span lang="fr"><cite>Causerie</cite></span>, a dozen or two dozen years
later; but it is very flattering on the whole, and well enough
deserved. The Master’s sword, however, as usual, in the
process of dubbing, finds out, lightly but unerringly, the joints
of the neophyte’s harness. <span lang="fr">“Les idées morales, religieuses,
chrétiennes, eurent toujours le pas dans son esprit sur les
opinions purement littéraires.”</span> This is the same peculiarity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>which, with a difference, afterwards distinguished Vinet’s
compatriot, M. Scherer: and it is very noticeable in the book
which we have selected for comment. <a id='sec9.5.9'></a><span class='sni side9'><i>His criticism of Chateaubriand and Hugo.</i></span> The gown and bands
of the Protestant pastor are perpetually hampering the critic’s
step and gesture, and flopping up into his eyes. He admires
Chateaubriand,<a id='r1087'></a><a href='#f1087' class='c010'><sup>[1087]</sup></a> but he is constantly stopping to
tell him how sad it is that he should confuse
Popish superstition with Christian verity. He
admires Victor Hugo<a id='r1088'></a><a href='#f1088' class='c010'><sup>[1088]</sup></a>—he does him indeed much
more justice than one might have expected, and than remarks
on Vinet himself would sometimes lead the second-hand
reader to think. But he is made unhappy as a man by Hugo’s
art-for-art’s-sake attitude, by his early royalism, by his later
anti-Christianity or non-Christianity: while as a professor he
is shocked by single-syllable lines, by audacious metaphors
(yet he himself finely says somewhere that “only one poet
has a greater range of metaphor than Hugo, and that is
Humanity itself”), by some real enormities and more escapades
of bravado. One is sometimes tempted to laugh at such things
as his review of <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Burgraves</cite></span>,<a id='r1089'></a><a href='#f1089' class='c010'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> with its tone of half-puzzled
seriousness, till one comes again to such excellent points as
the remark that “Hugo is sometimes mistakable for a parody
of Hugo.”</p>

<a id='sec9.5.10'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>His general quality.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, however, I confess that I find Vinet rather
estimable than enjoyable. He is distinctly <span lang="fr"><i>lourd</i></span>: though it
would be unjust and inaccurate to call him by the
dictionary equivalent of that term in English. He
carries his Chair too much with him,<a id='r1090'></a><a href='#f1090' class='c010'><sup>[1090]</sup></a> and seems to think it
necessary to set it down with an effort, and formally establish
himself in it, before he makes any deliverance. I do not—I
think I may at this eleventh hour ask my readers if I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>not justified this claim to impartiality—object to him because he
is what he calls a spiritualist in art, or because, against my
own views, he pronounces<a id='r1091'></a><a href='#f1091' class='c010'><sup>[1091]</sup></a> that there can be no such thing as
“pure” literature. I could produce from him a very large
number of acute and true critical <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, like those above
cited. He is never merely trivial or negligible: I do not think
that he was in the least indifferent about literature. But he
seems to me to leave his reader indifferent. His critical method
has none of that <span lang="fr"><i>maestria</i></span> which carries one away, and only
sets one down again when it chooses to relax its grip. There
is no stimulus in Vinet, such as we find after widely different
fashions in Sainte-Beuve himself and in Planche, in Saint-Victor
and in Taine—nay, even in M. Scherer. There is
neither persuasion nor provocation in him: he disposes you
neither to follow nor to fight.</p>

<a id='sec9.5.11'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Amiel: great interest of his critical impressions.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the famous and much-discussed work of Henri François
Amiel,<a id='r1092'></a><a href='#f1092' class='c010'><sup>[1092]</sup></a> we are fortunately concerned only with the literary
criticism, the value of which Mr Arnold duly saw,
though, in deference to other persons, perhaps, he
did not pay so much attention thereto as to some
other matters. This literary criticism is of great
interest, and I may as well say at once that I think M. Scherer
did not do it justice<a id='r1093'></a><a href='#f1093' class='c010'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> when he said of his friend that <span lang="fr">“en
littérature, il reculait devant une œuvre.”</span> He could not here
mean, what is true, that Amiel’s timid and half-despairing
nature recoiled before the completion of a work, for he makes
it a parallel with his recoiling before avowal in love, and
quotes his own words about his difficulty in “enjoying naïvely
and simply.” Undoubtedly this “moral eunuchism” (for it
is impossible not to think of the famous passage in <cite>Peter Bell
the Third</cite>) is to be laid to Amiel’s charge too often; but I think
conspicuously <em>not</em> in his presentments and judgments of literature.
He is here far more healthy and far more natural than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>anywhere else. Indeed, he is sometimes so very little sicklied
over with any pale cast that he frankly and naïvely records
his changes of impression about the same book as he reads.
These changes are, in tolerably active and sensitive natures,
so rapid and curious that some practised reviewers have made
it a principle, whenever they can, first to read the book they
are reviewing through, with as little interruption as possible,
lest the “plate” shift or change; and, secondly, never to review
it on the same day on which they read it, that the impressions
may have time to blend and harmonise. The most interesting,
perhaps, of Amiel’s records of experience in this kind is the
group of impressions of Eugénie de Guérin, which occur together
in the <cite>Journal</cite> at vol. i. p. 197. He reads and re-reads her on
successive September days in 1864, and reads her once more
in the middle of October. The first impression (which maintains
itself for the two days) is altogether one of enthusiasm,
not merely in regard to the sentimental side, the <span lang="fr"><i>impression
nostalgique</i></span>, &#38;c., but with a delighted recognition of <span lang="fr"><i>verve</i>, <i>élan</i></span>,
greatness of soul in this <span lang="fr">“Sévigné des Champs”</span> [Notre Dame
des Rochers will forgive!]. After the month’s interval he does
not recant: but finds a rather less charming side as well.
Eugénie’s existence is at once “too empty and too confined”:
he wants “more air and space.” Now both these impressions
are genuine and vivid: and, what is more, they are both
frankly taken and expressed, without any gaucherie or “feeling
faint,” any “touching the hem of the shift,” and daring
no more.</p>

<a id='sec9.5.12'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Examples thereof.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And this character of at least relative vivacity—of ease and
power in enjoyment—generally distinguishes, as it seems to me,
the literary entries, which have far less of what
some have called the <span lang="fr"><i>ton amielleux</i></span> about them than
any others. The description of the style of Montesquieu<a id='r1094'></a><a href='#f1094' class='c010'><sup>[1094]</sup></a> is
quite admirably true and fresh: and if that of Joubert<a id='r1095'></a><a href='#f1095' class='c010'><sup>[1095]</sup></a> is open
to more exception, it is precisely because Amiel is mixing up
Joubert’s utterances as a literary critic and his utterances as a
philosopher, &#38;c., too much; because he is not keeping his own
saner organ of judgment mainly at work. The fastidious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>morbid side does show itself in that on Rousseau, which follows
immediately: but this we should expect. On Vinet,<a id='r1096'></a><a href='#f1096' class='c010'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> though
too complimentary, as was for a dozen reasons almost inevitable,
he shows extraordinary acuteness and <span lang="fr"><i>finesse</i></span>, as also on Sismondi.<a id='r1097'></a><a href='#f1097' class='c010'><sup>[1097]</sup></a>
If he is less satisfactory on Chateaubriand, we can again
explain it, and he does justice to <span lang="fr"><cite>René</cite></span>. The apology for
Quinet<a id='r1098'></a><a href='#f1098' class='c010'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> is as judicious as it is sympathetic: and I know few
more curious and interesting companion passages in criticism
than those on Hugo and Lamartine earlier, on Corneille and
Hugo later, which occur almost together in the book, though
there was some time between the composition of them.<a id='r1099'></a><a href='#f1099' class='c010'><sup>[1099]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the first of these, the juxtaposition of the citations from
<span lang="fr"><cite>Les Châtiments</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Jocelyn</cite></span> is a stroke of genius; in the latter
batch, though it is quite clear that the judge does not completely
like either the author of <cite>Polyeucte</cite> or the author of
<span lang="fr"><cite>Les Misérables</cite></span>, the indication of characteristics is even greater
in another way, because more elaborated and responsible. On
M. Cherbuliez<a id='r1100'></a><a href='#f1100' class='c010'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> Amiel is again of the first interest, because the
slight over-valuation of compatriotism on the small scale is
balanced by a distinct antagonism of “nervous impression.”
And we have even a more curious “place” in the notice of
<cite>John Halifax</cite>,<a id='r1101'></a><a href='#f1101' class='c010'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> which is the last of our passages in the first
volume. Here Amiel’s starting-point is a vain imagination—the
usual misjudgment of things English, by a man who does
not know England—but the use made of it is singularly good.
The second volume gives us another invaluable pair on the
most antecedently <em>not</em> to be paired of writers, About and
Lotze—who nevertheless bring out between them the remarkable
powers of Amiel’s mind-camera. The summer of 1869
supplies more documents on Lamennais, Heine (inadequate
this latter, but again necessarily), and Renan, with admirable
obituary remarks to follow on Sainte-Beuve. One side of
Taine—the side up to the date almost solely in evidence—comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>out two years afterwards,<a id='r1102'></a><a href='#f1102' class='c010'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> and the remaining references
that I have are so numerous that I fear they, or rather some
of them only, must be collected in a note.<a id='r1103'></a><a href='#f1103' class='c010'><sup>[1103]</sup></a></p>

<a id='sec9.5.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The pity of it.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>We must, however, in order to take an accurate and complete
view of Amiel as a critic, and not merely of Amiel’s occasional
criticisms, remember that these <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, brilliant as
they are, are scattered over more than thirty years,
and that they form, as it were, the lucid intervals in a lifelong
night of moping, the islets far scattered and estranged from
another, amid the <span lang="la"><i>nigras undas lethargi</i></span>. That the man who
wrote them was, at the time of writing, almost invariably a
sane, mentally active, “moderately cheerful” being, is, I think,
absolutely beyond question; that he might, if he had chosen
to write more and to give himself more freely to that which
comes before the writing, have freed himself to a great extent
from his Melancholia, I have no doubt. Escape from that
dread yet sweet enchantress—that serpent not of old Nile but
of the older Ocean that flows round the world—no man can
wholly who has been born of her servants; probably no such
man would ever wish to do so. But there are two gates
of partial and temporary emancipation—the Gate of Humour
and the Gate of Study—which she usually permits to stand
open, and through which men may pass, lest her sway become
tyranny. That of Humour was apparently barred to Amiel:
the other evidently was not. But he would very rarely use it.
We know that he had many opportunities of contributing to
critical journals, and that he would not take them, but fled back
to Maya and the Great Wheel. Here the other, the more
popular, the more irritating, side of him comes in.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I can see no <em>pose</em> whatever in the literary entries.
On the contrary, their freshness and spontaneity make a very
remarkable contrast to almost all the rest of the book, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>perhaps a few of the Nature-passages. Still, they <em>are</em>
“intervals and islets” only—there is a singular want of
connection between them. Amiel seems seldom or never
to have troubled himself in the least about taking any connected
views of literature: he seldom or never extends the
remarkable comparative power which he shows in his various
companion sketches. And, further, I am not certain that if
he had attempted regular studies or <span lang="fr"><i>causeries</i></span> they would
have been good—that he would not have maundered off into
the vague instead of giving grasped views and judgments.
This, however, no one can decide. What remains positive
and proved is, first, that his intellect never shows to greater
advantage than in his literary passages.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="la"><i>Sed hæc hactenus.</i></span> I believe honestly, and not as a subterfuge
to cover pusillanimity or laziness, that if I were to give
here an examination of notable critics during the nineteenth
century from every nation and country in Europe, I should
not really advance the survey of criticism which we now
possess in the very least. Until a time so recent that it falls
out of our consideration, all these countries and nations have
most certainly been following—until, perhaps, one which is not
recent but still to come, they seem likely to follow, the same
course which the Three First have pursued before them, and
in most, if not in all cases, have followed their leaders in a
more definite order of sequence still. All, about the second or
third decade of the century, devoured Scott and Byron; all,
a little (or more than a little) later, reinforced our influence by
that of the French Romantic movement; most, earlier or later,
devoted themselves to that German literature which had in a
sense preceded ours, as it certainly had the French. In all,
the Romantic leaven worked itself out, under the conditions of
the literature and the individual, to spirit, or wine, or vinegar,
as the case might be. In all, “Realism” and “Naturalism,”
“Decadence” and “Preciousness,” showed themselves, as
similar things have shown themselves many a time before, in
the merry-go-round of history and of literature. Quite lately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>in some—Russian, Norwegian, Belgian, <span lang="fr"><i>que-sais-je?</i></span>—signs of
secondary fermentation have been shown, which have greatly
impressed some observers.  But it is as yet much too early to
take serious critical account of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so the long journey—the tale of length also, which
recounts it—may, if it actually must not, end with a few general
observations of summary and reflection, to correspond to those
which we have interspersed before.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1079'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1079'>1079</a>. One famous person may be noted
exceptionally. A critic who held political
and other views contrary to
Mazzini’s, and who thought (as too
many critics have apparently thought)
that it is lawful to wreak vengeance in
the literary sphere for sins committed
elsewhere, would have a considerable
opportunity with Mazzini himself, as a
critic. He has written not a little apparently
of the kind, and about very
important persons—Dante, Goethe,
Byron, Mr Carlyle, papers on all of
whom will be found in Mr William
Clarke’s useful English edition of
Mazzini’s selected Essays (London,
n.d.) He has said things for which,
if one were a Veuillot, one could, in
Veuillot’s own phrase, “promise him
sensations.” But this is not <em>our</em> way.
One soon sees (in fact, I think, he
frankly confesses it in more than one
place) that the writer is not thinking
of these great writers as writers at all,
nor of their books as books. He is
thinking of their relation, actual or by
ingenuity representable, towards his
idol of “Collective Humanity,” and
he is talking, as he is thinking, of
nothing else. We have nothing here
to do with Collective Humanity, but
much with the Humanities, which are
different: and so he escapes our jurisdiction.
Perhaps a good many more
modern Italians would do the same,
that influence of Vico, which we noted
in Signor Croce, being very strong in
them.</p>

<h3 id='c1' class='c013'>I.</h3>

<p class='c009'>In a letter (written on what was to prove his deathbed) which
I received from my friend of nearly forty years, the late
Bishop of London, in reference to the first volume of this
work, he said he had often wished it possible to begin books
of the kind at the end, and write backward, so as at once to
engage the interest of the reader on matter more or less known
to him, and to lead him on to the unknown by easy stages,
instead of plunging him into a bath of strange matter. I
nearly always found in Creighton’s utterances—from the time
when we used to outwatch the Bear in certain lofty rooms
looking over Merton Meadow, and the Broad Walk, and the
river, towards the full of the moon—a <em>Hinterland</em> as well as
a foreground of meaning.  And in this case, no doubt, the advantage
of such a topsyturvyfication, if it were practicable,
would not be confined to the reader. It is almost as important
to the writer that he should not lose himself too much
in “origins”—that he should keep fruit as well as root in
view—nay, that, if possible, he should have a sort of Alcinous'
garden of the subject before him, with its various developments
simultaneously present. I hope, indeed, that I have not quite
failed, as it is, to accomplish something of this tregetour-work
for my own benefit and the reader’s. Yet even “beginning at
the end” would have had its dangers, for in no part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>book is what we have sometimes called a “horizontal” view
more necessary, or more apparently hard to maintain, than in
this present. The immense mass of material which has to
be selected or rejected is an obvious difficulty: and the certainty
that, as readers in the earlier part have grumbled at
too extensive treatment of matters of which they knew nothing,
so in this later they will grumble at too curt treatment of
what they do know and expect to be treated fully—is equally
obvious. But these are not really formidable dragons or lions.
To grapple with the first is the plain and <span lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span> business
of the adventure, and to the second the adventurer must make
up his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the knight’s worst foes now, as of old, are not lions or
dragons, but treacherous and deluding enchanters and enchantresses,
taking advantage of his own weakness. And the difficulty
of keeping a steady, achromatic, comparative estimate
of the criticism of to-day and of yesterday is in this instance
Archimago and Duessa at once. We have seen, again and
again, during the progress of our history, how at one time—a
long time ago for the most part—Criticism has been entirely
bewitched by the idea of a Golden Age, when all poets were
sacred and all critics gave just judgment: how, at another,
a confidence, bland or pert as the case might be, has existed
(and exists) that we are much wiser than our fathers. Above
all, we have seen repeatedly that constant and most dangerous
delusion that the fashion which has just ceased to be
fashionable is a specially bad and foolish one, with its concomitant
and equally unreasonable but rather less dangerous
opposite, that the fashion that <em>is</em> in is the foolishest and feeblest
of all fashions. With these things we have hitherto had
to cope only at long bowls, so that it has been comparatively
easy to keep a critical head.  We are now at closest grapple
with them: and while it cannot but be difficult to escape or
to conquer, it will be wellnigh impossible not to seem captured
or vanquished to spectators who have themselves not fully
purged their eyes with the necessary euphrasy and rue.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these same dangers, however, the very fact of having
steadily worked through the history from the beginning, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>with an abiding memory of the end, should be something
of a safeguard for writer and reader alike. We have seen
how justly Mr Rigmarole might pronounce all times “pretty
much like our own” in respect of the faults and dangers of
criticism, though this time might incline to that danger and
that to this. If one—even one—lesson has emerged, it must
have been that to select the favourite critical fancy of <em>any</em>
time as the <span lang="la"><i>unum necessarium</i></span> is fatal—or redeemed only by
the completeness with which such a selection, when faithfully
carried out, demonstrates its own futility. Yet we have seen
also that the criticism of no time is wholly idle or wholly
negligible—that the older periods and the older men are no
“shadows,” but almost more real, because more original, than
the newer—that each and all have lessons, from the times
of prim and strictly limited knowledge to the times of
swaggering and nearly unlimited ignorance. And we should
not be quite unable to apply these.<a id='r1104'></a><a href='#f1104' class='c010'><sup>[1104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the preceding Book we have surveyed, in most cases
virtually and in some actually, to the end of the Nineteenth
century, the latest stage or stages of that modified and modernised
criticism, the rise of which was traced in the first Book
of the present volume, and its victorious establishment in the
second. We have seen how—owing partly, no doubt, to the
mere general law of flux and reflux, but partly, and perhaps
mainly, to the enlarged study of literature, and the breaking
down, in connection with this, of the Neo-classic standards and
methods,—judging <span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span>, or, as Johnson, prophesying and
protesting, called it, “by the event,” came to take the place of
judging <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, or by the rule. That in many cases the new
critics would not themselves have admitted this description of
their innovations we have not attempted to deny or disguise:
but we have not been able to agree with them. We have,
however, seen also that to satisfy the craving for generalities
and for “pushing ignorance further back,” new preceptist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>systems, in no small number, and sometimes of great pretensions
and no small complexity, have been advanced, and that
the new subject of “Æsthetics”—in itself little more than a
somewhat disorderly generic name for these systems—has obtained
considerable recognition. But no one of these has, nor
have all of them together, attained anything like that position
of acknowledgment, “establishment,” and authority which was
enjoyed by the Neo-classic faith: and we have seen that some
of the straitest doctrinaires have condescended, while the general
herd of critics have frankly preferred, to judge authors as they
found them.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the results have been in many ways satisfactory, it
seems impossible for any one but the extremest of partisans to
deny. The last and worst fault of any state, political or other,
that of “decreeing injustice by a law,” has been almost entirely
removed (at least as a general reproach) from the state of
Criticism. That a work of art is entitled to be judged on its
own merits or demerits, and not according as its specification
does or does not happen to be previously entered and approved
in an official schedule—this surely cannot but seem a gain
to every one not absolutely blinded by prejudice. Nor is it
the only point which ought to unite all reasonable suffrages.
By the almost necessary working of the new system, the <span lang="fr"><i>personnel</i></span>
of Criticism has been enlarged, improved, strengthened
in a most remarkable degree. The old opposition of the poet
and the critic has ceased to exist. It is true indeed that, as
we have seen, it never existed as an absolute law; but it was
a prevailing one, and it deprived criticism of some of its most
qualified recruits, or made them, if they joined, inconsistent, like
Lope, and Dryden, and Johnson. Nay, Coleridge himself could
hardly have been the critic he was under the older dispensation,
much less those other poets, many and of many countries, who
have enriched the treasury of a Goddess once thought to be
the poet’s deadliest foe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, again, putting the contributions of poets, as poets, on one
side, the general literary harvest of the kind has been undoubtedly
more abundant, and in its choicer growths more
varied, more delightful, even more instructive. A collection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>of the best critical results of the last fifty years only would
certainly yield in these points to no similar book that could
be compiled from the records of any other period, even of much
greater length. From the perfected craftsmanship of Saint-Beuve,
and the whole critical production of Matthew Arnold,
through the work of writers unnecessary to enumerate, because
all possible enumeration would almost necessarily be an injustice,
you might collect—not a volume, not half a dozen, but
a small, and not so very small, library, of which you could not
merely say “Here be truths,” but “Here is reading which any
person of ordinary intelligence and education will find nearly,
if not quite, as delightful as he can find in any other department
of <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span>, except the very highest triumphs of prose
and poetic Fiction itself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, the removal of the reproach of injustice, the removal
of the reproach of dulness, these are surely good and even great
things: while better, and greater still, is the at least possible
institution of a new Priesthood of Literature, disinterested,
teaching the world really to read, enabling it to understand
and enjoy, justifying the God and the Muse to Men.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a fair vision; so fair, perhaps, that it may seem to be,
like others, made of nothing more solid than “golden air.”
That would be perhaps excessive, for, as has been pointed out
above, the positive gains under this New Dispensation, both of
good criticism produced and of good literature freed from
arbitrary persecution, have been very great. But, as we foreshadowed
in the Interchapter at the end of the last volume,
there is another side to the account, a side not to be ignored.
If Buddha and Mr Arnold be right, and if “Fixity” be “a
sign of the Law”—then most assuredly Modern Criticism is not
merely lawless, but frankly and wilfully antinomian. It is
rare to find two critics of competence liking just the same
things; it is rarer still to find them liking the same things for
the same reason. And so it happens that the catholic ideal
which this New Criticism seemed likely to establish is just
as far off, and just as frequently neglected or even outraged,
as in the old days of strict sectarianism, and without the same
excuse. The eighteenth-century critic could render a reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span><span lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span> valid, for patronising Chaucer, and taking exceptions
even to Milton, because neither was like Dryden. But the
critic of to-day who belittles Dryden because he is not like
Chaucer or Milton is utterly without excuse:—and yet he is
to be found, and found in high places. If (as in another case)
critics were to be for a single day what they ought to be, the
world would no doubt be converted; but there certainly does
not appear to be much more chance of this in the one case
than in the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so the enemy—who is sometimes a friendly enemy
enough—has not the slightest difficulty in blaspheming,—in
asking whether the criterion of pleasure does not leave the
fatal difficulty: “Yes: but pleasure <em>to whom</em>?”; in demanding
some test which the simple can apply; in reproaching
“Romantic” critics with faction and will-worship, with inconsistency
and anarchy. Nor perhaps is there any better
shift than the old Pantagruelian one—to <span lang="fr"><i>passer oultre</i></span>. There
<em>are</em> these objections to the modern way of criticism: and
probably they can never be got rid of or validly gainsaid.
But there is something beyond them, which can be reached
in spite of them, and which is worth the reaching.</p>

<p class='c001'>This something is the comprehensive and catholic possession
of literature—all literature and all that is good in all—which
has for the first time become possible and legitimate.
From Aristotle to La Harpe—even to one of the two Matthew
Arnolds—the covenant of criticism was strictly similar to
that of the Jewish Law,—it was a perpetual “Thou shalt
not do this,” or “Thou shalt do this only in such and such
a specified way.” There might be some reason for all the
commandments, and excellent reason for some; but these
reasons were never in themselves immortal, and they constantly
tended to constitute a mortal and mortifying Letter.
The mischief of this has been shown in something not far
from two thousand pages, and there is no need to spend more
time on it. Nor is it necessary even to argue that in the
region of Art such a Law entirely lacks the justification which
it may have in the region of Morals.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it may fairly be asked, How do you propose to define
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span><em>any</em> principles for your New Critic? And the answers are
ready, one in Hellenic, one in Hebraic phraseology. The
definition shall be couched as the man of understanding would
define it: and if any will do the works of the New Criticism
he shall know the doctrine thereof. And the works themselves
are not hard to set forth. He must read, and, as far
as possible, read everything—that is the first and great
commandment. If he omits one period of a literature, even
one author of some real, if ever so little, importance in a period,
he runs the risk of putting his view of the rest out of focus;
if he fails to take at least some account of other literatures
as well, his state will be nearly as perilous. Secondly, he
must constantly compare books, authors, literatures indeed,
to see in what each differs from each, but never in order to
dislike one because it is not the other. Thirdly, he must,
as far as he possibly can, divest himself of any idea of what
a book <em>ought to be</em>, until he has seen what it is. In other
words, and to revert to the old simile, the plate to which he
exposes the object cannot be too carefully prepared and sensitised,
so that it may take the exactest possible reflection: but
it cannot also be too carefully protected from even the minutest
line, shadow, dot, that may affect or predetermine the
impression in the very slightest degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>To carry this out is, of course, difficult; to carry it out in
perfection is, no doubt, impossible. But I believe that it can
be done in some measure, and could be done, if men would
take criticism both seriously and faithfully, better and better—by
those, at least, who start with a certain favourable
disposition and talent for the exercise, and who submit this
disposition to a suitable training in ancient and modern literature.
And by such endeavours, some nearer approach to the
“Fair Vision” must surely be probable than was even possible
by the older system of schedule and precept, under which
even a new masterpiece of genius, which somehow or other
“forced the consign” and established itself, became a mischief,
because it introduced a new prohibitive and exclusive pattern.
I have said more than once that, according to the common
law of flux and reflux—the Revolution which those may accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>who are profoundly sceptical of Evolution—some return, not
to the old Neo-classicism, but to some more dogmatic and less
æsthetic criticism than we have seen for the last three
generations, may be expected, and that there have been
not a few signs of its arrival. But this is a History, not a
Prophecy, and sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.
Perhaps even the good is not quite so insufficient as the day
itself, “chagrined at whatsoe’er <em>it is</em>,” may be apt to suppose.</p>

<h3 id='c2' class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Who would has heard Sordello’s story told.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In these three volumes an endeavour has been made to
fulfil the pledge given at their beginning, and to set before
the reader, in a plain tale, what men have actually done, said,
and thought in Criticism of Literature, in Judging of Authors.
We have seen how the art grew up, like so many other arts,
as a sort of <em>parergon</em>, as a corollary upon the strictly practical
study of Rhetoric for the purpose of the orator: and how it
was long held in a sort of subjection to this <em>techne</em>, which, if
not exactly a <em>techne banausos</em>, certainly must rank far below
the study and the fruition of the whole of literature. We
have seen how, in the times called ancient, it never got wholly
free from this inferior position; how, in the times called
mediæval, it hardly showed any signs of life; how it revived
with the general new birth, and what have been its fortunes
since. There can be no need to pad this already stout volume
with abstracts of our Interchapters. The story of Criticism
is actually before the reader, and if he will not take it now,
that it is at last given to him, because there is wanting something
that is not the story, I cannot help it. No doubt there
are some, perhaps there are many, who honestly and impartially
think the story not worth giving, think it a story of
something, at best a superfluity, generally a failure, at worst
a nuisance, redeemable and excusable only (if then) by being
made to serve as illustration of some philosophic theory.
But I have said often enough and positively enough, though
I trust not too contumaciously, that I do not think so.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>And even if the record seem too often a record of failure
and mistake, there is a cheerful side to this also. Most of the
dangers of criticism, as this long survey must have sufficiently
taught those who care to learn, are comfortably and reassuringly
(if from another point of view despairingly) old. We know
they will come, and we know they will go, whether in our
time or in another we cannot say, but it does not much
matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Whole man idly boasts to find,” no doubt. Not many
have even attempted to do it; few who have attempted it
have succeeded in that comparatively initial and rudimentary
adventure which consists in justly finding the parts. But
Criticism is, after all, an attempt, however faulty and failing,
however wandering and purblind, to do both the one and the
other. No Muse, or handmaid of the Muses (let it be freely
confessed) has been less often justified of her children: none
has had so many good-for-nothings for sons. Of hardly any
have some children had such disgusting, such patent, such
intolerable faults. The purblind theorist who mistakes the
passport for the person, and who will not admit without passport
the veriest angel; the acrid pedant who will allow no
one whom he dislikes to write well, and no one at all to
write on any subject that he himself has written on, or
would like to write on, who dwells on dates and commas,
who garbles out and foists in, whose learning may be easily
exaggerated but whose taste and judgment cannot be, because
they do not exist;—these are the too often justified patterns
of the critic to many minds. The whole record of critical
result, which we have so laboriously arranged and developed,
is a record of mistake and of misdoing, of half-truths and
nearly whole errors.</p>

<p class='c001'>So say they, and so let them say: things have been said
less truly. But, once more, all this is no more Criticism
itself than the crimes and the faults of men are Humanity
in its true and eternal idea. Criticism is the endeavour to
find, to know, to love, to recommend, not only the best,
but all the good, that has been known and thought and written
in the world. If its corruption be specially detestable, its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>perfection is only the more amiable and consummate. And
the record of the quest, while it is not quite the record of
the quest for other Eldorados—while it has some gains to
yield, some moments of adeption, some instances of those
who did not fail—should surely have some interest even for
the general: it should more surely have much for those few
but not unworthy, faint yet pursuing, who would rather persevere
in the search for the unattainable than rust in acquiescence
and defeat.</p>

<p class='c001'>For to him who has once attained, who has once even
comprehended, the <em>ethos</em> of true criticism, and perhaps to
him only, the curse which Mr Browning has put in one
of his noblest and most poetic passages does not apply. To
him the “one fair, good, wise thing” that he has once grasped
remains for ever as he has grasped it—<em>if</em> he has grasped
it at first. Not twenty, not forty years, make any difference.
What has been, has been and remains. If it is not so, if
there is palling and blunting, then it is quite certain either
that the object was unworthy or that the subject did not
really, truly, critically embrace it—that he was following
some will-o'-the-wisp of fancy on the one hand, some baffling
wind of doctrine on the other, and was not wholly, in brain
and soul, under the real inspiration of the Muse. That this
adeption and fruition of literature is to a certain extent
innate may be true: that it is both idle and flagitious to
simulate it if it does not exist, is true. But it can certainly
be cultivated where it exists, and it probably in all cases
requires cultivation in order that it may be perfect. In any
fair state of development it is its own exceeding great reward,—a
possession of the most precious that man can have.
And the practical value of the Art of Criticism, and of the
History of Criticism (which, as in other cases, is merely the
exposition of the art in practice), is that it can and does
assist this development; that by pointing out past errors it
prevents interference with enjoyment; that it shows how to
grasp and how to enjoy; that it helps the ear to listen when
the horns of Elfland blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>(<i>I have thought this sketch worth giving, partly as an example of the kind of
excursus which might be appended, perhaps not without some advantage, and
certainly in some numbers, to this History. But I give it also because it
illustrates—in a manner which cannot be elsewhere paralleled at all in our
own country, and to which I know no Continental parallel—by a continuous
and unbroken chain of instances and applications, the course of European
as well as English theory, practice, and taste in Criticism, from a
period when the Neo-classic creed was still in at least apparently fullest
flourishing, through nearly two whole centuries, to what, in the eye of history,
is the present moment. The enforced vacation of the Chair after a single
decade at most, and its filling by popular election, and not by the choice
of an individual or a board, add to its representative character: and the usual
publication of at least some of the results, in each case, makes that character
almost uniquely discoverable in its continuity, while even the change of
vehicles from Latin to English is not without its importance. There is no
room here—and it would perhaps be unnecessary in any case—to anticipate
the easy labour of summarising its lessons. But I think they may be said
to emphasise the warning—frequently given or hinted already—that the
result of the altered conditions and laws of criticism is not clear gain. No
part of Mr Arnold’s best critical work was, I think, done for the Chair;
and I should myself be inclined to select, as the best work actually done
for it, that of Keble, who represents the combination of the old Classical-Preceptist
tradition, with something of the new comparison and free expatiation,
as well as very much of the purely appreciative tendency.</i>)</p>

<div class='c000'></div>
<a id='seca.1.1'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The holders.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This Chair—founded by Henry Birkhead, D.C.L., a Trinity man,
a Fellow of All Souls, and a member of the Inner Temple—began
its operations in 1708, the conditions of its tenure
(which have only recently been altered) providing for a
first holding of five years, a single renewal for the same period, and a
sort of rotation, in the sense that the same college could not supply
two successive occupants. The actual incumbents have been: 1708-18,
Trapp; 1718-28, Thomas Warton the elder; 1728-38, Spence;
1738-41, John Whitf(i)eld; 1741-51 (the most distinguished name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>as yet), Lowth; 1751-56, William Hawkins; 1756-66, Thomas
Warton the younger; 1766-76, Benjamin Wheeler; 1776-83,
Randolph; 1783-93, Holmes; 1793 to 1802, Hurdis. With the
nineteenth century a brighter order begins, all but one or two
of the Professors having made their mark out of the Chair as well
as in it. They were: Copleston, 1802-12; Conybeare, 1812-21;
Milman, 1821-31; Keble, 1831-42; Garbett (the dark star of this
group, but, as we shall see, not quite lightless), 1842-52; Claughton,
1852-57; Matthew Arnold, 1857-67; Sir Francis Doyle, 1867-77;
Principal Shairp, 1877-87; Mr Palgrave, 1887-95; while of living
occupants Mr Courthope resigned the Chair after a single tenure; and
Mr Bradley was elected to it under a statutory limitation to this term.</p>

<a id='seca.1.2'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Eighteenth century minors.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of these, Trapp, Spence, the younger Warton, and Arnold have
received notice in the text, which would have been theirs had they
never held the Chair. The lucubrations of the first
held for some time an honourable place as an accepted
handbook on the subject. Spence, profiting by the
almost Elysian tolerance of his sensible century, and
finding that neither residence nor lecturing was insisted on, seems
to have resided very little, and to have lectured hardly or not at
all. Tom Warton the younger, whose <cite>History</cite> would have dignified
any <span lang="la"><i>cathedra</i></span>, appears to have devoted himself during his actual
tenure entirely to the classics, and never to have published any of
his lectures except one on Theocritus. His father, in the interval
between the respectable labours of Trapp and the philosophical
silence of Spence, had earned no golden opinions, and though the
repeated attacks of Amherst in <span lang="la"><cite>Terræ Filius</cite></span> may have been due
partly to political rancour, and partly to that ingenious and unlucky
person’s incorrigible Ishmaelitism, it seems to have been admitted
that the Professor’s understanding and erudition lay very open to
criticism, and that his elocution and manner were not such as could
shield them. Of Whitfield, Hawkins, Wheeler, Randolph, and
Holmes, what I have been able to gather may best be set in a
note.<a id='r1105'></a><a href='#f1105' class='c010'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> The first person to make any real figure in and for the Chair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>was the author of <span lang="la"><cite>De Sacra Poesi Hebræorum</cite></span>, which at once attained
not merely an English but a European reputation.</p>

<a id='seca.1.3'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Lowth.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>To discuss the Hebrew scholarship of this famous book (which
was first published in 1753, and repeatedly reprinted, revised,
translated, attacked, defended) would be wholly out of
place here, even if the writer had not almost wholly forgotten
the little Hebrew he learnt at school. It is still, I believe—even
by specialists with no general knowledge of literature—admitted
to have been epoch-making in its insistence on the
parallelism of Hebrew poetry. But to those who take the historical
view of literature and of criticism its place is secure quite apart
from this. Not merely in the Renaissance, but in the Middle and
even the Dark Ages, the matter of the Bible had been used to
parallel and illustrate rhetorical and literary doctrines and rules.
But Lowth was almost the first to treat its poetical forms from
something like the standpoint of sound comparative literary criticism.<a id='r1106'></a><a href='#f1106' class='c010'><sup>[1106]</sup></a>
Now this, as the whole tenor of our book has gone to
contend, was the chief and principal thing that had to be done.
If we have any advantage over the men of old, it is that we (or
some of us) have at last mastered the fact that one literature or
one language cannot <em>prescribe</em> anything to another, but that it may
<em>teach</em> much. And this new instance of a literature—unique in
special claims to reverence, unique likewise in the fact that in its
best examples it could owe nothing to those Greeks and Romans
who have so beneficently but so tyrannously influenced all the
modern tongues—was invaluable in its quality and almost incalculable
in its moment. That Lowth’s exposition resulted directly or
indirectly in not a little maladroit <em>imitation</em> of Hebrew poetry was
not his fault; his critical lesson was wholly good.</p>

<a id='seca.1.4'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Hurdis.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Hurdis, a person now very much forgotten, had his day of interest
and of something like position. He is not unfrequently quoted by
writers, especially by Southey, of the great period of
1800-1830, which he a little preceded, and he has the
honour—rare for so recent a writer—of a whole article<a id='r1107'></a><a href='#f1107' class='c010'><sup>[1107]</sup></a> on his
poems in the <cite>Retrospective Review</cite>. As a poet he was mainly an imitator
of his friend Cowper—a fact which, with the title of his chief
work, <cite>The Village Curate</cite>, will give intending or declining readers a
sufficiently exact idea of what they are undertaking or relinquishing.
Easy blank verse, abundant and often not infelicitous description,
and unexceptionable though slightly copybook sentiments,<a id='r1108'></a><a href='#f1108' class='c010'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> form his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>poetic or versifying staple. As a critic I regret to find that my note
on him is “Chatter”: and I do not know anything of his that makes
me, on reflection, think this unjust.</p>

<a id='seca.1.5'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>The rally: Copleston.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I should be half afraid that the interest which I feel in the next
set of Prælections, those of Edward Copleston,—“<em>the</em> Provost,” as
he anticipated Hawkins in being to Oxford men, even
not of his own college of Oriel,—might be set down to
that <span lang="la"><i>boulimia</i></span> or morbid appetite for critical writings of
which I have been accused, if I had not at hand a very potent
compurgator. Keble, it is true, was a personal friend of Copleston’s.
But he was not at all the man to let personal friendship, any more
than personal enmity, bias his judgment; and he was admirably
qualified to judge. Yet he says deliberately<a id='r1109'></a><a href='#f1109' class='c010'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> that the book “is by
far the most distinct, and the richest in matter, of any which it has
fallen to our lot to read on the subject.” I cannot myself go quite
so far as that, and I doubt whether Keble himself would have gone
so far when, twenty years later, he wrote his own exquisite Lectures;
but I can go a long way towards it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The future Provost and Bishop has, indeed, other critical proofs on
which to rely,<a id='r1110'></a><a href='#f1110' class='c010'><sup>[1110]</sup></a>—the famous and excellent “Advice to a Young Reviewer,”
which I fear is just as much needed, and just as little
heeded, as it was a hundred years ago, the admirable smashing of
the <cite>Edinburgh’s</cite> attack on Oxford, and other matters,—but the <cite>Prælections</cite><a id='r1111'></a><a href='#f1111' class='c010'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>
are the chief and principal thing. Keble insisted that they
ought to be Englished, but I am not so sure. They form one of
the <em>severest</em> critical treatises with which I am acquainted; and some
of the features of this severity would, I think, appear positively
uninviting in English dress, while they consistently and perfectly suit
the toga and the sandal. But I must explain a little more fully in
what this “severity” consists; for the word is ambiguous. I do not
mean that Copleston rejects Pleasure as the end of Poetry; for, on
the contrary, he writes <span lang="la"><i>Delectare</i></span> boldly on his shield, and omits
<span lang="la"><i>prodesse</i></span> save as an indirect consequence. I do not mean that he is
a very Draconic critic of particulars, though he can speak his mind
trenchantly enough.<a id='r1112'></a><a href='#f1112' class='c010'><sup>[1112]</sup></a> Nor do I mean that he is a very abstract
writer; for every page is strewn with concrete illustrations, very
well selected, and, for the most part, un-hackneyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>His severity is rather of the ascetic and “methodist” kind; he
resembles nothing so much as a preceptist of the school of Hermogenes,
who should have discarded triviality, and risen to very
nearly the weight and substance of Aristotle. At the very beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>he makes a statute for himself, to cite no literature but Greek
and Latin, and to use no language but these.  And he never breaks
either rule; for though, on rare occasions, he refers to English writers—Shakespeare,
Milton, Dryden, Burke, Reynolds<a id='r1113'></a><a href='#f1113' class='c010'><sup>[1113]</sup></a>—it is a reference
only to books, or poems, or passages, never a citation.  And in the
second place his method is throughout—constant as is his use of the
actual poetic object-lesson—to proceed by general categories, not of
poetic kinds (he shuns that ancient and now well-beaconed quicksand<a id='r1114'></a><a href='#f1114' class='c010'><sup>[1114]</sup></a>)
but of qualities, constituents, means.  His whole book, after
a brief definition or apology for not defining, is distributed under
four parts,—Of Imitation, Of the Emotions, Of Imagination
(Phantasia), and Of Judgment,—though he never reached the
fourth,<a id='r1115'></a><a href='#f1115' class='c010'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> owing to his tenure of the Chair coming to an end.  After
a pretty full discussion of the nature and subject of Imitation, he
makes his link with his next subject by dwelling on the <span lang="la"><i>Imitatio
morum</i></span>, and so of the Passions themselves.  In this part a very large
share is given to the subject of <span lang="la"><i>Sententiæ</i></span>—“sentiments,” as Keble
translates it, though, as I have pointed out formerly,<a id='r1116'></a><a href='#f1116' class='c010'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> no single translation
of the word is at all satisfactory.  The section on Imagination
is very interesting.  Copleston is at a sort of middle stage between
the restricted Addisonian and the wide Philostratean-Shakespearean-Coleridgean
interpretation of the word.  He expressly admits that
other senses besides sight can supply the material of <span lang="la"><cite>Phantasia</cite></span>;
but his examples are mainly drawn from material which <em>is</em> furnished
by the sight, and his inclusions of Allegory, Mythology, &#38;c., with
other things, sometimes smack of an insufficient discrimination
between Imagination and Fancy.  Indeed the fact that he is Præ-Coleridgean
helps to give him his interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Keble mildly complains that Copleston does not make use of that
doctrine of Association which he himself, writing so early, had
perhaps adopted, not from Coleridge but direct from Hartley.  We
have, in our day, seen this doctrine worked to death and sent to
the knacker’s in philosophy generally; but there is no doubt that
it can never be neglected in poetry, being, perhaps, the most universal
(though by no means <em>the</em> universal) means of approach to the sources
of the poetic pleasure.  It does not, however, seem to me that
Copleston intended to mount so high, or go so far back: his aim
was, I think, more rhetorical, according to a special fashion, than
metacritical.  But his mediate axioms are numerous and often very
informing: and his illustrations, as has been said, abundant, really
illustrative, and singularly recreative.  He lays most Latin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>many Greek poets under contribution; but some of his most effective
examples are drawn from a poet whom he does not critically overvalue,
but who has no doubt been, as a rule, critically undervalued,
and for whom he himself evidently had a discriminating affection—that
is to say, Claudian.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, the appearance of a book of this scope and scheme,
at the very junction of the centuries and the ’isms, Classic and
Romantic, is of singular interest. Until intelligent study of the
Higher Rhetoric—reformed, adjusted, and extended—has been reintroduced,
such another will not come. But such another might
come with very great advantage, and would supply a very important
<span lang="la"><i>tertium quid</i></span> to the mere Æsthetics and to the sheer Impressionism
between which Criticism has too often divided itself.</p>

<a id='seca.1.6'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Conybeare.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There is almost as much significance in Copleston’s successor,
though it is a significance of a different kind. For J. J. Conybeare
was the first Professor of Poetry to bestow attention on
Anglo-Saxon (Warton, even in his <cite>History</cite>, had not gone,
with any knowledge, beyond Middle English), and so to complete
the survey of all English Literature. Before his appointment he had
held, as its first occupant, the chair of Anglo-Saxon itself; and while
Professor of Poetry he was a country parson. He died suddenly and
comparatively young, and his remarkable <cite>Illustrations of Anglo-Saxon
Poetry</cite><a id='r1117'></a><a href='#f1117' class='c010'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> were published after his death by his brother, who is
actually responsible for a good part of its matter, so that the book
is a composite one. It is thus mainly in its general significance—for
Conybeare’s Prælections as Professor were not, so far as I know,
published—that it is valuable for us. But the value thus given is
unmistakable. Conybeare’s individual judgments and <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> are
always interesting, and often acute; but his real importance lies
in the fact that he was almost the first—though Mitford, after Ellis,
had attempted the thing as an outsider—to move back the focussing-point
sufficiently to get <em>all</em> English Literature under view. Nothing
could serve more effectually to break up the false standing-ground of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<a id='seca.1.7'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Milman.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>A curious but perhaps not surprising thing about Milman’s Professorship
is that it aroused the ire of an undergraduate poet of
the rarest though of the most eccentric type—namely,
Beddoes. If Milman really did “denounce” <cite>Death’s
Jest-Book</cite>,<a id='r1118'></a><a href='#f1118' class='c010'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> it is a pity that his lectures were (so far as I know)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>never printed, or at least collected, for there might have been more
such things of the fatally interesting kind which establishes the rule
that Professors should not deal, in their lectures, with contemporary
literature. It was certainly unlucky for a man to begin by objecting
in one official capacity to <cite>Death’s Jest-Book</cite>, and to end by objecting
in another to Stevens’s Wellington Monument. And that Milman
had generally the character of a harsh and donnish critic is obvious,
from Byron’s well-known suggestion of him as a possible candidate
for the authorship of the <cite>Quarterly</cite> article on Keats, though the
rhyme of “kill man” may have had something to do with this. If
he wrote much literary criticism we have little of it in the volume
of <cite>Essays</cite> which his son published, after his death, in 1870. Even
on Erasmus—surely a tempting subject—he manages to be as little
literary as is possible, and rather less than one might have thought
to be; and his much better-known <cite>Histories</cite> are not more so.</p>

<a id='seca.1.8'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Keble.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Ignorance may sneer, but Knowledge will not even smile, at the
dictum that not the least critical genius that ever adorned the Oxford
Chair was possessed by John Keble. There is some faint
excuse for Ignorance. The actual <span lang="la"><cite>Prælections</cite></span><a id='r1119'></a><a href='#f1119' class='c010'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> of the
author of <cite>The Christian Year</cite>, being Latin, are not read: his chief
English critical works,<a id='r1120'></a><a href='#f1120' class='c010'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> though collected not so very long ago, were
collected too late to catch that flood-tide, in their own sense, which
is unfortunately, as a rule, needed to land critical works out of
reach of the ordinary ebb. Moreover, there is no question but
Keble requires “allowance”; and the allowance which he requires
is too often of the kind least freely granted in the present day.
If we have anywhere (I hope we have) a man as holy as Keble, and
as learned, and as acute, he will hardly express the horror at Scott’s
occasional use of strong language which Keble expresses.<a id='r1121'></a><a href='#f1121' class='c010'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> Our
historic sense, and our illegitimate advantage of perspective, have
at least taught us that to quarrel with Scott again, for not being
“Catholic” enough, is almost to quarrel with Moses for not having
actually led the children of Israel into Palestine. And no man,
as honest as Keble was, would now echo that other accusation
against the great magician (whom, remember, Keble almost adored,
and of whom he thought far more highly as a poet than many good
men do now) of tolerating intemperance; though some might feign
it to suit a popular cant.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in all these respects it is perfectly easy for those who have
once schooled themselves to this apparently but not really difficult
matter, to make the necessary allowance.<a id='r1122'></a><a href='#f1122' class='c010'><sup>[1122]</sup></a> And then, even in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>English critical Essays—the “Scott,” the “Sacred Poetry,” the
“Unpublished Letters of Warburton,” and the “Copleston”—<span lang="la"><i>verus
incessu patet criticus</i></span>.</p>

<a id='seca.1.9'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>The</i> Occasional [<i>English</i>] Papers.</div>

<p class='c001'>His general attitude to poetic criticism (he meddled little with
any other) is extremely interesting. His classical training impelled
him towards the “subject” theory, and the fact that his
two great idols in modern English poetry were Scott and
Wordsworth was not likely to hold him back.  He has
even drifted towards a weir, pretty clearly, one would
think, marked “Danger!” by asking whether readers do not feel
the attraction of Scott’s novels to be as great as, and practically
identical with, that of his poems.  But no “classic” could possibly
have framed the definition of poetry which he puts at the outset<a id='r1123'></a><a href='#f1123' class='c010'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> of
the Scott Essay as “The indirect expression in words, most appropriately
in metrical words, of some overpowering emotion, or ruling
taste, or feeling, the direct indulgence whereof is somehow repressed.”
Everybody will see what this owes to Wordsworth; everybody should
see how it is glossed and amplified—in a non-Wordsworthian or an
extra-Wordsworthian sense.  We meet the pure critical Keble again,
in his enthusiastic adoption of Copleston’s preference for “Delight”
(putting Instruction politely in the pocket) as the poetic criterion.<a id='r1124'></a><a href='#f1124' class='c010'><sup>[1124]</sup></a>
And his defence of Sacred Poetry, however interested it may seem
to be, coming from him, is one of the capital essays of English
criticism.  He makes mince-meat of Johnson, and he takes by
anticipation a good deal of the brilliancy out of his brilliant
successor, Mr Arnold, on this subject.  The passage, short but
substantial,<a id='r1125'></a><a href='#f1125' class='c010'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> on Spenser in this is one of the very best to be
found on that critic of critics (as by an easily intelligible play he
might be said to be) as well as poet of poets.  Spenser always finds
out a bad critic—he tries good ones at their highest.</p>

<a id='seca.1.10'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>The</i> Prælections.</div>

<p class='c001'>Still the <span lang="la"><cite>Prælections</cite></span> themselves must, of course, always be Keble’s
own touchstone, or rather his ground and matter of assay.  And he
comes out well.  The dedication (a model of stately enthusiasm)
to Wordsworth as <span lang="la"><i>non solum dulcissimæ poeseos
verum etiam divinæ veritatis antistes</i></span>, strikes the keynote
of the whole.  But it may be surprising to some to find how
“broad” Keble is, in spite of his inflexible morality and his uncompromising
churchmanship.  He was kept right partly, no doubt, by
holding fast as a matter of theory to the “Delight” test—pure and
virtuous delight, of course, but still delight, first of all and most of
all.  But mere theory would have availed him little without the
poetic spirit, which everywhere in him translates itself into the
critical, and almost as little without the wide and (whether deliberately
so or not) comparative reading of ancient and modern verse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>which he displays. His general definition of Poetry here is slightly
different from that given above, as was indeed required by his subject
and object. He presents it—at once refining and enlarging
upon part of the Aristotelian one of Tragedy, and neutralising the
<span lang="la"><i>vinum dæmonum</i></span> notion at once,—as <span lang="de"><i>subsidium benigni numinis</i></span>, the
medicinal aid given by God to subdue, soften, and sanctify Passion.
But his working out—necessarily, in its main lines, obvious but
interesting to contrast with his successor Mr Arnold’s undogmatised
and secularised application of the same idea<a id='r1126'></a><a href='#f1126' class='c010'><sup>[1126]</sup></a>—is less interesting to
us in itself than the <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> on different poets, ancient and modern,
to which it gives rise. Few pages deserve to be skipped by the
student: even technical discussion of the <span lang="la"><i>tenuis et arguta</i></span> kind, as he
modestly calls it, becomes alive under his hand on such subjects as
the connection of Poetry and Irony (<span lang="la"><cite>Præl.</cite></span> v.) But there is a still
higher interest in such things as the contrast, in the same Prælection,
of the undeviating self-consistency of Spenser in all his work, the
bewildering apparent lack of central unity in Shakespeare with its
resolution, and the actual inconsistency of Dryden. All the Homeric
studies deserve reading, the discussion of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> in <span lang="la"><cite>Præl.</cite></span> xi.
being especially noteworthy, with its culmination in that delightful
phrase about Nausicaa which we quoted in the last volume.<a id='r1127'></a><a href='#f1127' class='c010'><sup>[1127]</sup></a>
Particularly wise and particularly interesting is the treatment of
“Imitation” (the lower imitation) in <span lang="la"><cite>Præl.</cite></span> xvi., where those who
are of our mystery will not fail to compare the passage with Vida.
How comfortable is it to find a poet-critic, so uncompromising on
dignity of subject, who can yet admit, and that with not the faintest
grudging, that it “is incredible how mightily the hidden fire is
roused by single words or clauses—nay, by the sound of mere
syllables, that strike the ear at a happy nick of time.”<a id='r1128'></a><a href='#f1128' class='c010'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> This is
almost “the doctrine of the Poetic Moment” itself, though we must
not urge it too far, and though it is brought in apropos of the suggestiveness
<em>to poets</em> of antecedent poetic work. It is still sovereign
against a still prevailing heresy. The abundant treatment of
Æschylus<a id='r1129'></a><a href='#f1129' class='c010'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> is also to be carefully noted; for, as we have observed, that
mighty poet had been almost neglected during the Neo-classic period.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second score of Lectures is still technically devoted to the
ancients, especially Pindar, the second and third Tragedians, Theocritus,
Lucretius, Virgil, and Horace; but references to the moderns,
not very rare in the first volume, become still more frequent here,
and are sometimes, as those to Spenser and Bunyan in the matter
of allegory,<a id='r1130'></a><a href='#f1130' class='c010'><sup>[1130]</sup></a> and the contrast of Jason and Macduff as bewailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>their children,<a id='r1131'></a><a href='#f1131' class='c010'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> very notable. On his narrower subject, the judgment
of Sophocles in <span lang="la"><cite>Præl.</cite></span> xxviii. is singularly weighty; and I
should like to have heard Mr Matthew Arnold answer on behalf
of his favourite. The comparative tameness, and the want of
variety and range, which some (not all, of course) feel in the
“singer and child of sweet Colonos” are here put with authority
by one whom no one could accuse of <span lang="de"><i>Sturm und Drang</i></span> preferences,
or of an undisciplined thirst for novelty. Only on Theocritus,
perhaps, does Morality sit <i>in banco</i> with Taste to a rather disastrous
effect, and the fact is curiously explicable. His disapproval of
Scott’s strong language, and his want of ecclesiastical-mindedness,
and his lenity to liquor, had not blinded Keble in the least to Scott’s
poetry; he had admitted the charitable and comfortable old plea
of “time, not man,” in favour of certain peccadilloes of Shakespeare;
he is, in fact, nowhere squeamish to silliness. But he
cannot pardon Theocritus for the <cite>Oaristys</cite> and such things, simply
because the new Wordsworthian nature-worship in him is wounded
and shocked <span lang="la"><i>insanabiliter</i></span>. “Like Aristophanes,” he says, “like
Catullus, like Horace, Theocritus betakes himself to the streams
and the woods, not to seek rest for a weary mind, but as provocatives
for a lustful one.”<a id='r1132'></a><a href='#f1132' class='c010'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> This new “sin against the Spirit”
is most interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, this very nature-worship keeps his balance,
where we might have thought he would lose it, on the subject of
Lucretius. He contrasts the comparative triviality and childishness
of Virgil, agreeable enough as it is, in regard to nature, with the
mystic majesty of his great predecessor. The charges of atheism
and indecency trouble him very little:<a id='r1133'></a><a href='#f1133' class='c010'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> the intense earnestness,
the lofty delight in clouds and forests and the vague, the likeness
to Æschylus and Dante—all these things he fixes on, and delights
in. I wish he had written more on Dante himself; what he has<a id='r1134'></a><a href='#f1134' class='c010'><sup>[1134]</sup></a>
is admirable.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to Virgil in person, though sensible enough of his merits, he
says things which would have elicited the choicest combinations of
Scaligerian Billingsgate; and brings out, in a way striking and I
think rather novel, the <span lang="la"><i>permolestum</i></span>, the “serious irritation” caused
by the fact that Virgil either could not or would not give Æneas
any character at all, and that you feel sometimes inclined to think
that he never himself had any clear idea what sort of a real man
his hero was. This exaltation of the Character above the Action
is very noteworthy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>But, in fact, Keble always is noteworthy, and more. Mere moderns
may dismiss him, with or without a reading, as a mill-horse treader of
academic rounds. He is nothing so little. He is, in fact, almost the
first representative of the Romantic movement who has applied its
spirit to the consecrated subjects of study; and he has shown, unfortunately
to too limited a circle, how fresh, how interesting, how
inspiring the results of this and of the true comparison of ancient
and modern may be.<a id='r1135'></a><a href='#f1135' class='c010'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> Literary criticism—indeed literature itself
as such—was with him, it is true, only a by-work, hardly more than
a pastime. But had it been otherwise, he would, I think, twenty
years before Arnold, have given us the results of a more thorough
scholarship, a reading certainly not less wide, a taste nearly as
delicate and catholic, a broader theory, and a much greater freedom
from mere crotchet and caprice.</p>

<a id='seca.1.11'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Garbett.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I am not quite so well acquainted with the whole work of Keble’s
successor Garbett.<a id='r1136'></a><a href='#f1136' class='c010'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> Elected as he was, by the anti-Tractarian reaction,
against the apparently far superior claims of
Isaac Williams, his appointment has generally been
regarded as a job; and I had to divest myself of prejudice in
reading him. He has indeed nothing of his predecessor’s serene
scholarship, and little of his clear and clean taste. His form puts
him at a special disadvantage. Instead of Keble’s pure and flowing
Latinity, you find an awkward dialect, peppered after the fashion
of Cicero’s letters with Greek words, peppered still more highly
with notes of exclamation, and, worst of all, full of words, and
clauses, and even whole sentences, in capitals, to the destruction of
all repose and dignity. He seems to have simply printed each
Prælection as he gave it (the pagings are independent), and then
to have batched them together without revision in volume form.<a id='r1137'></a><a href='#f1137' class='c010'><sup>[1137]</sup></a>
But one cannot read far or fairly without perceiving that, either
before his election or after it, Garbett had taken the pains to qualify
by a serious study of antecedent criticism—a study, it may be
added, of which there is hardly any trace in Keble. Garbett devotes
especial attention to Longinus and Dryden; and though I do not
(as I have formerly hinted)<a id='r1138'></a><a href='#f1138' class='c010'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> agree with him in regard to either,<a id='r1139'></a><a href='#f1139' class='c010'><sup>[1139]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>it is beyond all doubt that he had made a distinct and original
attempt to grasp both as critics.  He deals with Horace, of course;
but it is noteworthy that he has again aimed at a systematic and
fresh view, taking Horace as the master of “Art Poetic,” and
comparing Boileau, &#38;c.  He has an abundant discussion of Scaliger,
whom he takes as third type and (rightly) as the father of classical
French criticism, while Dryden gives him his fourth.  He knows
the Germans—not merely Lessing and Goethe, but Kant; and
whatever the failures in his execution, he can “satisfy the examiners”
not merely from the point of view of those who demand
acquaintance with the history and literature of the subject, but
from that of those who postpone everything to what they think
philosophy.  He refers to the climatic view of literature,<a id='r1140'></a><a href='#f1140' class='c010'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> constantly
combines historical and literary considerations, and is altogether a
“modern.”  As has been said, I disagree with him more often than
I agree; but I do not think there can be any serious denial of the
fact that he was worthy of the Chair and of a place here.</p>

<a id='seca.1.12'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Claughton.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The tenure of his successor Claughton, afterwards Bishop, was
but for a single term; and he seems to have left little memorial
of it except a singularly elegant Latin address on the
appointment of Lord Derby as Chancellor.  Elegance,
indeed, was Claughton’s characteristic as an orator,<a id='r1141'></a><a href='#f1141' class='c010'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> but I should
not imagine that he had much strength or very wide or keen
literary knowledge and enthusiasm.  Of Mr. Arnold we have
spoken.</p>

<a id='seca.1.13'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Doyle.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>There were foolish folk, not without some excuse of ignorance
(if that ever <em>be</em> an excuse) for their foolishness, who grumbled or
scoffed when he was followed by Sir Francis Doyle.
There had been some hopes of Browning, which had
been foiled—if by nothing else—by the discovery that an Honorary
M.A. degree was not a qualification; and it must be owned that
curiosity to see what Browning would do <em>in</em> prose <em>on</em> poetry was highly
legitimate.  Moreover, the younger generation was busy with
Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Morris, who had not turned Tennyson and
Browning himself out, and they knew little of Sir Francis.  Better
informed persons, however, reported of him as of an Oxford man
of the best old type of “scholar and gentleman,” a person of very
shrewd wits, of probably greater practical experience than any
Professor of Poetry had ever had, and the author of certain things
like <cite>The Red Thread of Honour</cite> and <cite>The Private of the Buffs</cite>, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>in their own peculiar style and division, were poetry <span lang="fr"><i>sans phrase</i></span>.
The report was justified by the new Professor’s Lectures.<a id='r1142'></a><a href='#f1142' class='c010'><sup>[1142]</sup></a>  They
are frankly exoteric; but they are saved by scholarship from the
charge of ever being popular in the bad sense.  They adopt as
frankly, and carry a little farther, that plan of making the lectures,
if not exactly reviews of particular books new and old, at any rate
<span lang="fr"><i>causeries</i></span> hung on particular texts and pegs, which the vernacularisation
of the Chair had made inevitable, and to which Matthew Arnold
himself had inclined gladly enough.  They are, though not in the
least degree slipshod or slovenly, quite conversational in style.
But they deserve, I think, no mean place among the documents of
the Chair.  Their easy, well-bred common-sense, kept from being
really Philistine (which epithet Sir Francis good-humouredly
accepted), not merely by their good breeding, but by the aforesaid
scholarship, by natural acuteness, and by an intense unaffected love
for poetry, might not be a good staple.  But if the electors could
manage to let it come round again, as an exception, once in a generation
or so, it would be well, and better than well.</p>

<a id='seca.1.14'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Shairp.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of Principal Shairp so many good men have said so many good
things that it is almost unnecessary to add, in this special place
and context, the praise (which can be given ungrudgingly)
that he has always, in his critical work, had before him
good intentions and high ideals.  Much further addition, I fear,
cannot be made.  When I read his question, “Did not Shakespeare
hate and despise Iago and Edmund?”<a id='r1143'></a><a href='#f1143' class='c010'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> when I remember how
Shakespeare himself put in the mouth of the one—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I bleed, sir, but not killed”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>in the mouth of the other—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The wheel is come full circle; I am here”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>and—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yet Edmund was beloved,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I own I sympathise with an unconventional and unsophisticated
soul who, once reading this same utterance of Mr. Shairp’s, rose,
strode about the room, and sitting down, ejaculated, “What are
you to do? What are you to say? Where are you to go? when
a Professor of Poetry, uttering such things in Oxford, is not taken
out, and stoned or burnt forthwith, between Balliol and the
<cite>Randolph</cite>?”  And there is an only less dreadful passage<a id='r1144'></a><a href='#f1144' class='c010'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> of miscomprehension
on the magnificent close of Tennyson’s “Love and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>Duty”—one of the greatest examples of the difficult “<span lang="de"><i>Versöhnung</i></span>
close,” the reconciliation of art, the relapse into peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the lesson of criticism is a lesson of tolerance. A complete
and careful perusal of Mr Shairp’s <cite>Aspects of Poetry</cite>, and of his
other books, will indeed show that the <span lang="la"><i>apices</i></span> of criticism,
whether historical, or appreciative, or even philosophical, were beyond
his climb. He shows that constant necessity or temptation of
engaging in comment—eulogistic or controversial—upon the <span lang="la"><i>ephemera
critica</i></span> of the time, which has been one of the worst results of
the change of the lectures from Latin to English. You could not,
in the stately old vehicle, do more than occasionally decline upon
such a lower level as this. Mr Shairp is always citing and fencing
with (or extolling reviewer-fashion) Arnold or Bagehot, Hutton
or Myers. <span lang="la"><i>Quotidiana quotidie moriuntur</i></span>; and, though no doubt
it saves much trouble to Professors if they can take out of a newspaper
or a review, or even a recent book, on their way to Oxford,
a text for an hour’s sermon, their state <span lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span> is
far from the more gracious. Oxford is constantly making new
statutes now; I think one forbidding any citation from this Chair
of critical or creative literature less than thirty years old would
not be bad.</p>

<p class='c001'>More happy, if not always more critical, were his dealings with
things Scottish, where sympathy lifted him out of the peddling,
and transformed the parochial. On Burns (even though there
must have been searchings of heart there) he could sometimes,
though by no means always, speak excellently; on Scott
superexcellently; on Wordsworth almost as well; on the Highland
poets (if we do not forget our salt-cellar) best of all, because he
spoke with knowledge and not as Mr Arnold. His work is always
amiable, often admirable: I wish I could say that it is always
or often critical.<a id='r1145'></a><a href='#f1145' class='c010'><sup>[1145]</sup></a></p>

<a id='seca.1.15'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Palgrave.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The great achievement of Mr Shairp’s successor, Francis Turner
Palgrave, in regard to literary criticism, is an indirect one, and had
been mostly done years and decades before he was
elected to the Chair. Indeed, I think little if anything
was given to the world as the direct result of his professorial work.
As an actual critic or reviewer, Palgrave was no doubt distinguished
not over-favourably by that tendency to “splash” and <span lang="fr"><i>tapage</i></span> of
manner which he shared with Kinglake and some other writers of
the mid-nineteenth century, and which has been recently revived.
But his real taste was in a manner warranted by his friendships;
and his friendships must almost have kept him right if he had
had less taste. He may have profited largely by these friendships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>in the composition of the two parts of that really <cite>Golden Treasury</cite>,
which, if it does not achieve the impossible in giving everybody
what he wants, all that he wants, and nothing that he does not
want, is by general confession the most successful attempt in a
quite appallingly difficult kind. The second part, which has of
course been the most criticised, seems to me even more remarkable
than the first, as showing an almost complete freedom from one
easily besetting sin, the tendency not to relish styles that have come
in since the critic “commenced” in criticism.</p>

<a id='seca.1.16'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><span lang="la">Salutantur vivi.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Of the late and the present holders of the Chair we
are happily precluded from speaking critically. May

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1105'>1105</a>. Of Whitfield (or Whit<em>feld</em>, as some
write) I have found nothing but that
he wrote some Latin verses on William
the Third. The second volume of
William Hawkins’s <cite>Tracts</cite> (1758) contains,
besides a ridiculous tragedy,
<cite>Henry and Rosamond</cite>, an <cite>Essay on
Drama</cite>, principally occupied by carpings
at Mason’s <cite>Elfrida</cite>, and some
Letters on Pope’s Commentary on
Homer—very small critical beer.
About Wheeler I find less even than
about Whitfield. The piety of his son
published—long after date and in our

John Randolph, a man who, besides
holding several other professorships
at Oxford, attained to eminence in the
Church, and died Bishop of London in
1813. They are very sober and respectable.

oftener than it has been. But
Randolph sticks in the bark and the

<p class='c001'>I am very well aware of the arguments which may be advanced
against attempting to extend our survey of criticism across the
Atlantic. I at least do not undervalue the apparently
formal, but in truth real, objection that we have undertaken
<em>European</em> criticism only: while I appreciate the
opposite demur, that the space of an appendix is as
uncomplimentary and as uncomplementary as total exclusion would
be. But after having taken counsel of more than one American
friend, by no means specially Anglophile in temper, I found that,
apparently, the inclusion even in this form would be at least sometimes
taken in the spirit in which it is meant, while on the other
hand I had myself felt very strongly the disadvantage of excluding
such a critic as Mr Lowell, who has all the characteristics of the
best of our own with an inviting <span lang="la"><i>differentia</i></span>. The bursting-point,
however, of this volume is pretty nearly reached; and I must again
observe that there is no invidious intention in the proportion of
the notice. I have endeavoured to allot to Mr Lowell himself a
space (allowing for differences of scale and type) not, I think,
unfair in proportion to his English fellows; others I have had to
survey more in summary. But I hope that the whole may at any
rate provide a not inadequate outline-sketch of the subject; and
in this hope I submit it, not merely to English readers, but to those
still more nearly concerned, from some of whom this book has received
attention at once of the most candid (in the better pre-Sheridanian
sense of that word) and of the most searchingly
competent.</p>

<a id='seca.2.2'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Its difficulties.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The difficulties of the task are complicated by the necessity, according
to our plan, of omitting living writers. The history of
American criticism appears, even more than that of
other departments of literature, to be very mainly a
history of the present; and I could write <span lang="la"><i>ex abundanti</i></span> on that.
The “middle distance” is also well provided. But the origins are
singularly obscure, and appear to be regarded with neither pride
nor interest by Americans themselves. When I thought of this
excursus first, some years ago, I was referred by an American friend
to two articles<a id='r1146'></a><a href='#f1146' class='c010'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> which had appeared not long before in <cite>The International
Monthly</cite> on “American Literary Criticism and the Doctrine
of Evolution.” The title gave me some forebodings in its doubleness;
yet this might be interpreted favourably, for how can you
treat the “evolution” of a subject without treating its history? I
found, however, that the author, though his papers lacked neither
thought nor style, was wholly occupied with the doctrine of evolutionary
criticism generally, as against judicial and appreciative; and
that he did not even propose to meddle with the history of his
subject save by occasional allusion. The histories of American
literature have afforded me something more, but not much.</p>

<a id='seca.2.3'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>The early stages.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>I do not mention this in any spirit of fault-finding, for few people
are less likely than myself to need reminding that in literary and
critical history, as elsewhere, you cannot make bricks
without straw, and still less without clay. There was,
and there could be, little attempt at important criticism
in “colonial” times, and the immense material expansion of the
earlier Republican period was very little more favourable to it than
the quiescence and dependence of the Monarchical.<a id='r1147'></a><a href='#f1147' class='c010'><sup>[1147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The definite entrance of the United States into the society of
nations, after the second war with England and the settlement of
Europe by the final suppression of Napoleon, as necessarily brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>with it the organisation of critical as of other employment for the
intellect.  <a id='seca.2.4'></a><span class='sni side12'><i>The origins and pioneers.</i></span>
 There is something agreeably Arcadian in
the idea of Longfellow, a boy of nineteen, being sent to
Europe by the trustees of his college to qualify himself
for a Chair of Literature; but the fact is no more and no less
creditable to these functionaries than it is symbolic of the new
tendencies of the time.  Still, Longfellow was not actually the
apostle of comparative and extensive criticism in America. Ticknor,
his elder by eighteen years, had, partly no doubt by this very fact of
the admission of his country to the full franchise of nations, been induced
to give up the study and practice of the law, and to devote
himself to literature, in the very year of Waterloo itself.  And he
too, after a sojourn in Europe, became, some years before his fellow
at Bowdoin, Professor of Modern Languages and Belles Lettres at
Harvard. Emerson, born between the two, was a little later in
treading the same road than either, but he trod it; and his visit to
Europe, in 1833, determined the critical writings and lectures which
followed.</p>

<p class='c001'>These three I should take to be the founders of American
criticism of the adult and accomplished kind, and they represent it,
interestingly enough, in three different ways.  It is true that no one
of them is first of all a critic, or even, as Mr. Lowell was afterwards,
a critic in power at least equal to that of any other of his qualities.
But this was only in the nature of things.</p>

<a id='seca.2.5'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Ticknor.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It is not merely because Ticknor’s lifework was a literary history
that one may call him first of all a literary historian. The fact that
the <cite>History of Spanish Literature</cite>, more than fifty years
after its publication, and nearly seventy after its inception,
although the interval has been one of the fiercest in pursuing,
and one of the most voluminous in recording, literary explorations,
retains, and is likely to retain, its position not merely as a classic,
but as an authority, shows some pre-established harmony between
writer and task. Yet, though the provinces of the literary historian
and the critic overlap to a very large extent,—though the historian
who is not a critic must be a mere reference-monger, and the critic
who is not a historian a mere bellettrist,—yet there are skirts and
fringes of each province which are not necessarily part of the other.
Ticknor is rather less of a critic than he is of a historian—his
grouping of facts, his investigation and statement of them, his perception
of origins and connections, are all a little superior to his
appreciation pure and simple.  Yet there are few who can afford to
look down on him in this latter respect; and as historical critic and
critical historian I do not know where to look for his superior, while
I should have very soon done looking for his equals.</p>

<a id='seca.2.6'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Longfellow.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Longfellow (for it will be convenient to take Emerson last) shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>us, as a matter of course, a different critical phase.  He never, so far
as I know, wrote any connected study of literature, and
I do not think that it would have been very good if
he had.  His lectures, which were necessarily numerous, and the
articles which he wrote (I believe in no small numbers) have never
taken any important position, and again I should doubt whether, if
we had them or more of them, anything very remarkable would be
included.<a id='r1148'></a><a href='#f1148' class='c010'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>  Yet he had, and displayed in the intensest degree, that
most agreeable and not least profitable function of the critical faculty
which attaches itself to literature, assimilates it, transforms it into
instruction and delight.  This is noticeable in almost every page of
his poems: it is the very genesis of many of them, and perhaps of
the best of them: it is at once the explanation and the refutation of
the charge of want of originality brought against him.  So in his
prose. <cite>Hyperion</cite> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Outre-Mer</cite></span> are permeated and saturated with it.
The literature of Germany, the literature of Spain, have done more
than colour the poet’s or prose-writer’s work; they have penetrated
to its substance, fed it, been digested and absorbed into its very life.
From <cite>The Golden Legend</cite> and <cite>The Spanish Student</cite> to the smallest
fragments this process is noteworthy.  And while it shows, on the
part of the writer himself, processes necessary to the critic, in
intenser and more poetic form, it performs on the reader “the office
of the critic”—his hierophantic, initiating, inoculating office—in the
most vivid and forcible manner and degree. No one who, susceptible
to literature, but more or less ignorant of it, reads Longfellow
but must, consciously or unconsciously, imbibe something of
literature itself—of a literature far wider and deeper than that
which the poet (though I speak as a lifelong lover of Longfellow’s
poetry) himself creates.</p>

<a id='seca.2.7'></a><div class='sidenote side5'><i>Emerson.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That Emerson also is not first of all a critic is not surprising,
because, as most people have seen, Emerson is not, first of all,
anything but Emerson.  But he is in some ways more
of a critic than either of the others, and the reason why
he is not more so still is that, like his master or analogue Carlyle,
he rather refuses to look on literature as literature.  His ethical
preoccupations and his transcendentalism alike prevent him from
doing this—he is Carlyle <i>plus</i> Vinet.  In the second place, if I may
say so without offence, he shows us, as neither Ticknor nor Longfellow,
both of whom were too cosmopolitan, shows us, the American
touch-me-not-ishness, the somewhat unnecessary affectation of
nationality.  The literary chauvinism of the famous lecture on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>“The American Scholar” is perhaps more apparent than real; but
his query, “Who is Southey?” in the record of his interview with
Landor, is awkward. “Southey is, say what you like about his
poetry or his politics, one of the greatest <em>men of letters</em> of all time,”
is the answer which a critic should have given to himself. Yet there
is much good positive criticism in Emerson (if there can be said
to be anything positive in him), and there is still more of that vague
stimulative force which is so noticeable in these first great writers of
America, and which is so interesting when we consider their circumstances,
individual and national. In the <cite>English Traits</cite> and the
<cite>Representative Men</cite>, in the lectures and elsewhere, there is always
ringing to the fit ear the “<span lang="fr"><i>Tolle, lege!</i></span>” of the greater critics, with
the comment which helps to make the book understood, when it is
taken up and read.</p>

<a id='seca.2.8'></a><div class='sidenote side3'><i>Poe.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>By the ’Thirties and ’Forties of the nineteenth century the European
pilgrimage was no longer necessary to fetch the critical spark home.
American criticism became abundant, and not merely
abundant. In no case do I so much regret the necessity
of compression as in that of Poe. The extreme and almost incomprehensible
injustice with which the ill-fated author of <cite>Ligeia</cite> and
<cite>The Haunted Palace</cite> was so long treated by his countrymen has, I
believe, abated; and I have seen, in the article referred to, a complimentary,
though merely passing, reference to him as a critic. But
there is still room, I think, for some substantial <span lang="de"><cite>Rettung</cite></span>, as Lessing
would have said. The substance would have to be considerable, for
the matter under consideration,<a id='r1149'></a><a href='#f1149' class='c010'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> which is not small in bulk, is heterogeneous,
and even to some extent chaotic. More than any other
part of Poe’s work it is the scapegoat of his unfavourable circumstances,
of his patchy education, of his weaknesses in conduct, temper,
and constitution. A great deal is mere hack-writing—<span lang="fr"><i>chaînes de
l’esclavage</i></span>—stuff never meant to abide the steady judgment of
posterity. You may, if you please, pick out of it the most amazing
things, such<a id='r1150'></a><a href='#f1150' class='c010'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> as that “for one Fouqué there are fifty Molières” (I
am no undervaluer of Fouqué, but I wish—I <em>do</em> wish—that I knew
where to look for even one of the forty-nine additional Poquelins);
and “for one Dickens ... five million ... Fieldings,” where
perhaps five million marks of exclamation might not inadequately
meet the case. Generous as is the praise which he heaps upon Mrs
Browning and Mr Horne; true as much of what he says is; one feels
that his observations want <em>reducing</em>, adjusting, co-ordinating under
the calmer influence of comparative and universal criticism. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>was not the slightest reason why he should get into such a frantic
rage with, the “devilled kidneys” (a most pleasant and wholesome
food) in that very pleasant and wholesome book <cite>Charles O’Malley</cite>;
or why he should have so furiously resented Mr Lowell’s remarks
on himself in the <cite>Fable for Critics</cite>, open as these are to criticism;
or why he should have said or done a hundred other things of the
kind. His “hungry heart and burning,” his ill-disciplined intellect
and temper, drove him in all sorts of directions, and not unfrequently
in the wrong ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet his critical instincts were almost always right; and not seldom
they were remarkably original. Considering what the ways of poets
are, and that Poe had his full share of the then prevailing American
soreness towards “British” writers, I know few things in literature
more pleasant and edifying at once than his enthusiastic and intelligent
welcome of Tennyson. “The Rationale of Verse,” though there
are faults in it, due to ignorance or carelessness in terminology, to
haste, and to imperfect reading, is one of the best things ever written
on English prosody, and quite astonishingly original. Although,
when he takes a great deal of pains it is apt to be rather lost labour,
as, for instance, in the comically laborious dissection of Longfellow’s
<cite>Spanish Student</cite> (a delightful thing if taken in the proper way),
the acuteness which he often shows even in such pieces, and much
more in his lighter <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, is remarkable. The <span lang="la"><cite>Marginalia</cite></span> are full
of good things—I find, after reading them anew for this purpose,
that my reference slips “stand like the corn arow.” His dislike of
German criticism<a id='r1151'></a><a href='#f1151' class='c010'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> may have been half opposition to Carlyle, between
whom and himself there was a gulf fixed; and he should
not have said that Macaulay had more true critical spirit than both
the Schlegels put together. But this very passage is worth pondering,
and it was very bold at the time. I do not think he borrowed
the true observation of the resemblance between <cite>Hudibras</cite> and the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Satyre Menippée</cite></span>.<a id='r1152'></a><a href='#f1152' class='c010'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> His defence of the “rhetorician’s rules”<a id='r1153'></a><a href='#f1153' class='c010'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> is just
and lively: it is not a little noteworthy that he, the most apparently
irregular and spasmodic of men of genius, perfectly understands the
importance of Form.</p>

<p class='c001'>And all this, let it be remembered, was written, not merely in
distress, and in disease, and sometimes in despair, but—to adapt
the Dickensian and Gautieresque juxtaposition—in the ’Thirties and
'Forties, when, as we have seen, criticism in England itself had
fallen into the state from which it was aroused by Matthew Arnold
years after Poe’s death; when Carlyle was turning his back on it,
when Macaulay was acknowledging that he was not the man for it,
when the men who meddled with it were showing absolute want
of comprehension of Tennyson, and passing Browning over as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>beneath their notice. It was written in spite of the bad influence
(discernible enough, as it is, in Poe) of the swaggering, swashbuckler
fashion of “British” criticism itself. It was written before—long
before in most cases—Lowell came to his maturity as a critic. It is,
except in flashes and indications, mostly a might-have-been. But
that might-have-been, translated into fact, would, I think, have ranked
with the most noteworthy critical achievements that we possess in
regard to poetry and <span lang="fr"><i>belles-lettres</i></span>. On other departments Poe could
probably never, in the most favourable circumstances, have laid much
hold. But in his own sphere he not only did the works, but knew
those who did them and how they were done.</p>

<a id='seca.2.9'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Lowell: his general position.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, however, I suppose that a majority of the best
judges would award the place of premier critic of America to Mr
Lowell, and I should certainly not attempt to contest the
judgment. He had, in an eminent degree, most of the
qualities which our long examination has enabled us to
specify as generally found in good critics; catholic and
observant reading, real enthusiasm for literature, sanity of judgment,
good-humour, width of view, and (though this perhaps in rather
less measure than the others) methodic arrangement and grasp.
He was free, not merely from the defects which are the opposites
of these good qualities, but from others—the niggling and carping
of the gerund-grinder and the <span lang="la"><i>gradus</i></span>-hunter,<a id='r1154'></a><a href='#f1154' class='c010'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> the hideboundness
of the type-and-kind critic, and above all the incomprehensible and
yet all-pervading inability to like something because it is not something
else. He could put his perceptions brightly and forcibly—in
a way perhaps rather tempting to re-read than at once sinking
into the memory, but not the less excellent, and perhaps (in criticism)
rather the more uncommon, for that.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the wrong side of the account there are of course some things
to put. I shall not be suspected of wishing to banish quips and
cranks from criticism, but Mr Lowell was perhaps a little too
prodigal of them. His patriotism was a little aggressive—not in
the way (which he had far too much critical good sense ever to
tread) of overvaluing his countrymen’s literary performances, but
in too often infusing into his criticism a sort of <span lang="la"><i>Nemo-me-impune-lacessit</i></span>
flavour which was quite unnecessary, and in fact almost
entirely irrelevant. And lastly, as has been hinted above, his grasp
was not always sure. To compare the two papers on Gray, written
at no great interval of time, by him and by his slightly younger
contemporary Mr Arnold, is very interesting and instructive. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>not sure that, if it were just (or indeed possible) to extract separate
good critical things, like nuggets, from the two essays, and weigh the
parcels against each other, the American would not prove the richer,
even allowing weight for length. But Gray is not “put” in the
Harvard man’s essay as he is in the Oxonian’s: the critical contact is
less full and vital, the congress less complete. It may be urged,
indeed, that the selection is not quite fair, because of the unusual
sympathy, and as it were harmony pre-established, between the
Graian and the Arnoldian temperaments; but the same slight shortcoming
will be found elsewhere.<a id='r1155'></a><a href='#f1155' class='c010'><sup>[1155]</sup></a></p>

<a id='seca.2.10'></a><div class='sidenote side9'>Among my Books.</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Lowell’s best known book of literary criticism is, no doubt,
<cite>Among my Books</cite>; but though it shows his method characteristically
enough, it is by no means mainly bookish: in fact, I
think there is rather less in it about the literary part of
the matter than in others. The famous essay on
“Dryden” is of course a standard, and perhaps its author’s diploma-piece
as a critic; and the “Shakespeare once More” (a title suggested
by Goethe) is a very interesting literary <i>pot-pourri</i>. But the
“Lessing” and the “Rousseau” are chiefly biographical; and such
papers as “Witchcraft” and “New England,” attractive as they are,
are from the literary point of view quite “off,” as literary slang has
it. There is nothing to object to in this, for the general title covers
subjects suggested by books, or the subjects of books, quite as amply
as books-by-themselves-books; and there can be no doubt that the
reader usually likes the others best. But the whole volume shows
its author well as a scholar but not a pedant, a man of letters who is
also a man of the world, and a judge who, though by no means
ideally impartial, and even with a tolerably well-stuffed portfolio of
prejudices, can give judgments not to be pooh-poohed at the worst,
and at the best things worthy to take their place with the best of
judge-made law in our subject.</p>

<a id='seca.2.11'></a><div class='sidenote side9'>My Study Windows.</div>

<p class='c001'>The equally well-known <cite>My Study Windows</cite> does not contain, as
the title may seem to intimate, matter of <em>more</em> mixed quality as
regards pure literature, but the quality is still
mixed. Mr Lowell was not happy in his reception of
the avatar of Mr Swinburne: it is indeed so rare for a
man of more than middle age to be quite at focus with a new poet,
that some of the wiser or more pusillanimous of our kind decline in
such cases to register a formal judgment. The “Carlyle” is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>tainted by political prejudice, though it does credit to Mr Lowell’s
perspicacity to have so early found out in Carlyle that real “Toryism”
which was so long mistaken. But the “Chaucer” and the “Pope”—differ
here and there with them as we may or must—are solid and
substantive contributions to the main shelf of criticism; while in the
lower ranges “The Life and Letters of James Gates Perceval” only
needed more quotation and more ruthlessness to make it a pendant
to Macaulay’s “Montgomery.”</p>

<a id='seca.2.12'></a><div class='sidenote side9'>Essays on the English Poets.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Essays which have been reprinted in England, with the permission
of Mr Lowell and with a Preface by his own hands, as <cite>Essays
on the English Poets</cite><a id='r1156'></a><a href='#f1156' class='c010'><sup>[1156]</sup></a> (including those on Lessing and
Rousseau as a very welcome though not exceedingly
relevant bonus or make-weight), are partly drawn from
the two books just noticed. Some of them seem to have
been written rather early; most were originally lectures to a university,
and may have a little sacrificed literature to instruction. The best by
a good deal is, I think, the “Wordsworth,”<a id='r1157'></a><a href='#f1157' class='c010'><sup>[1157]</sup></a> which, though there are
many good essays on Wordsworth to make up for the many bad ones,
deserves to rank almost with the best. It is seldom that in a single
essay one finds such a capital specimen of delicate appreciation as the
comparison of the fall of Goethe’s <span lang="de"><cite>Ueber allen Gipfeln</cite></span> to “blossoms
shaken down by a noonday breeze on turf”; so good an example of
the criticism of epigram as “Wordsworth is the historian of Wordsworthshire”;<a id='r1158'></a><a href='#f1158' class='c010'><sup>[1158]</sup></a>
and so fine and just a critical simile as the comparison
of Milton’s verse to a mixed fleet of men-of-war and merchantmen,
which comes shortly after. The “Milton” itself has more to do with
Milton’s editor and biographer than with Milton, and is marred by
that curious impatience of a reasoned prosody which appears in Mr
Lowell so often. So is the Spenser—quite admirable in great part
of it—by the author’s well-known and excessive depreciation of
fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century poetry.<a id='r1159'></a><a href='#f1159' class='c010'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> The “Keats” leaves
off just when we are expecting the critic to begin. As if to carry
out unity of cross-purpose, if of nothing more, the “Lessing” hardly
says anything about Lessing’s criticism, and the “Rousseau” is
chiefly about Rousseau as a man. But though, putting the “Wordsworth”
aside, the contents of the volume would hardly have given us
a fair idea of Mr Lowell’s critical powers by themselves, it could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>have been written by no bad critic as a whole, and in part could
only have been written by a very good one.</p>

<a id='seca.2.13'></a><div class='sidenote side7'><i>Last Essays.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As nearly always, too, this critic’s last work is of his best. The
“Gray” we have noticed. The “Landor” is mainly, though not
wholly, personal; and the “Walton,” as a “Walton”
must be and ought to be, rather of life rather than of
literature. But the paper on the <span lang="la"><cite>Areopagitica</cite></span> is an admirable
piece, and “On the Study of Modern Languages” stands, I think,
alone among the  arguments on its side, distinguished at once by
competent knowledge and judicial fairness in regard to ancient and
modern alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much critical gift, indeed, of so wide a range and so happy in
its display, is seldom to be found. And though nothing is more impertinent
than to recommend a representative to a constituency to
which you do not yourself belong, I think that perhaps these volumes
may give me the right to say that if I were an American I should
vote for Mr Lowell, and that whatever might be my nationality I
should say “Well done!” if he were elected.</p>

which, with hardly an alteration, is so admirable and final a description

<a id='seca.2.16'></a><div class='sidenote side12'><i>Whitman and the “Democratic” ideal.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The poet who seems to some possibly rash non-American persons
to divide with Poe the prize due to the worthiest in American
poetry, was also a critic—less of the professional kind,
much more <span lang="fr"><i>borné</i></span>, but more concentrated, and in some
ways more influential. The critical views of Walt
Whitman are scattered all over his not inconsiderable
works, but are to be found brought together and marshalled most
aggressively in his prose <cite>Democratic Vistas</cite>, with their “General
Notes,” and in the <span lang="la"><i>numeris lege solutis</i></span> of the <em>Song of the Exposition</em>.
According to these views, though Whitman speaks of individual
writers (not merely Shakespeare but even Scott) with warm admiration,
and with nothing of the curious blindness which has characterised
some of his followers in the line, “English literature is not
great” because it is anti-Democratic and Feudal. These “Notes”
must develop something quite different, and of the nature of an
antidote. All “warrior epics” are “void, inanimate, passed,” and
so forth. The expression of this is often, as Whitman’s expression
constantly is, admirable, and the temper of it is always intentionally
wholesome and generous. If I regard it as hopelessly bad criticism,
it is not (to repeat the refrain once more) because I disagree with its
conclusions, but because it seems to me to start from a hopelessly
wrong principle, and to proceed on hopelessly mistaken methods.
That principle and those methods, <span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, would justify
<em>me</em> in dismissing—nay, would force me to dismiss—as void, inanimate,
worthless, mischievous, something of Heine, much of
Shelley, more of Hugo, and very nearly the whole of Whitman
himself—four poets in four different countries born, whom, as it
happens, if I were the responsible literary adviser of a new King
Arthur of Poetry, I should bid him summon among the very first
to his Round Table. To the critic, as I understand criticism
(and if I may adapt a famous text of Scripture), Feudalism is
nothing and Democracy is nothing, but the Spirit of Literature.
Whitman did not think so, and unfortunately his ideas (which may
have been partly suggested by Emerson) have found followers
who have not always mellowed and antidoted the crude poison of
theory with the generous wine of temperament and expression.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>Of the remarkable, if somewhat abortive, “Transcendental” group
in the latter part of the first half of the nineteenth century, George
Ripley and Margaret Fuller seem to call for notice here: as specimens
of later writers, Whipple and Sidney Lanier may suffice, in the impossibility
of including a considerable <span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span>.<a id='r1161'></a><a href='#f1161' class='c010'><sup>[1161]</sup></a></p>

<a id='seca.2.17'></a><div class='sidenote side9'><i>Margaret Fuller.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The critical writings of the Marchesa Ossoli are, I suppose, chiefly
contained in the volumes of her works entitled <cite>Art, Literature, and
Drama</cite>, and <cite>Life Without and Life Within</cite>. They have
much interest, and I think deserve the position assigned
to her<a id='r1162'></a><a href='#f1162' class='c010'><sup>[1162]</sup></a> as the first American woman who had regularly
trained for criticism, and as being in a way the chief of all such to the
present day. They have, however, certain characteristics which perhaps
might be anticipated. The merely silly reproach of transcendentalism
leaves “Margaret” unscathed. She does not talk nonsense.
But she does talk a little vaguely and loosely; and it does seem rather
difficult for her to keep her eye steadily on any one object. We know
that she will overvalue Goethe; it was, as we have pointed out, the
very form and pressure of the time that made her do so, and probably
to no country was the gospel according to Wolfgang a more powerful
and beneficent gospel than to the United States of America in the
second quarter of the nineteenth century. But when we read, <em>in
English</em>, that “the frail Philina, graceful though contemptible, presents
the degradation incident to an attempt at leading an exclusively
poetic life,” or that “not even in Shakespeare” has she “felt the
organising power of genius as in” Ottilie of the <span lang="de"><cite>Wahlverwandtschaften</cite></span>,
we think a great deal more than there is room or necessity here to say.
The article on Poe’s Poems is very curious; the critic appears as a sort
of she-Balaam, without that unlucky prophet’s generous frankness
when he found he could not help it; she cannot ban, and will not
bless freely. That on <span lang="de"><cite>Philip van Artevelde</cite></span> is more curious still in
another way. It makes the most enormous and yet indecisive sweeps
before attacking its subject, feints at the whole question of Classic <i>v.</i>
Romantic, says more about Alfieri (who seems to have been Margaret’s
favourite poet) than about Taylor, and finally despatches the nominal
theme in very few and very inadequate words. She is always attractive<a id='r1163'></a><a href='#f1163' class='c010'><sup>[1163]</sup></a>—this
“<em>Margarita</em> del Occidente”—this new “Margarite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>America,” and the ideas which, before reading, some may have formed
of her as of a sort of “mother of all such as are schoolmarms” melt
at once in contact with her work. But would she ever have become
a great critic? I doubt it; she certainly had not become one when
she died. She was thinking of things other than the Power of the
Word. Better, if anybody likes; but other.</p>

<a id='seca.2.18'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Ripley.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Her editor, I think, and, with Emerson, certainly her teacher, the
Reverend George Ripley, did very much to imbue his country with
foreign literature; not a little to help it to understand
that literature. Ripley has been very highly spoken of,
by good authorities, for the attempts which he made to produce a
higher standard and a wider range of literary scholarship in the
United States: and in fact there is no doubt that the Transcendental
group did yeoman’s service in this way, their work not a little resembling
that done in Germany a hundred years, or a little less, earlier.
But I do not know many of his later Reviews in the <cite>Tribune</cite>, and
his <cite>Specimens of Foreign Literature</cite>, two volumes published at Boston
in 1838 as the ushers and samples of a much larger library of the
subject, are not in the least literary, but purely philosophical. They
give translated extracts from Cousin, Jouffroy, and Benjamin Constant,
with Introductions and rather copious notes or short excursus.
The whole shows knowledge, judgment, and a real critical capacity;
but these good gifts are, as has been said, devoted to the philosophic,
not the literary character and achievement of their subjects,
and it is very noticeable that of the nearly twenty books or parts
of books which are announced as to form the intended library, more
than half are purely philosophical and only a small part purely
literary.</p>

<a id='seca.2.19'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Whipple.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Of Whipple I chiefly know the two volumes of <cite>Essays and Reviews</cite>,
which appeared as long ago as 1849. He must have written much
else, as he did not die till 1886; but the contents of
these volumes are bulky enough and varied enough, I
should suppose, to afford a fair field of judgment. His countrymen have,
I believe, rather outgrown him, and do not at present rank him very
high; but the “perspective of the past,” as it “firms,” will probably
establish him in a fair though not a very high place. He seems to
me to have been one of the first American writers who set themselves
to be critics without further ambitions, and took literature calmly to
be their province in the judicial way. He might, no doubt, have
had more style: not that his is bad, but that it is undistinguished,
wanting more grace to win that prize and more vigour to win the
other. He might also have had more grasp. His dicta are occasionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>unfortunate: one reads that Pinkney has written “as well as
Lovelace and Carew, better than Waller, Sedley, <cite>Etherege</cite>, and
Dorset”; and asks for those works of Pinkney which are as good as
“To Althea,” and “To Lucasta,” and “To A. L.”; better than
“Phillis is my only Joy” and “To all you Ladies.”<a id='r1164'></a><a href='#f1164' class='c010'><sup>[1164]</sup></a> And it is
strange to find a man in two minds about Keats, and sure that Barry
Cornwall has “splendid traits of genius.” But these things will
happen. I do not know what Whipple’s education was, but I should
rather doubt whether he had been sufficiently brought up on the
chief and principal things to keep his eye from wandering and
“wobbling.” His article on the Elizabethan dramatists has a fatal
look of being founded rather on Lamb and Hunt and Hazlitt than
on Dodsley and Dilke. Still he is by no means a merely negligible
quantity in our calculus. He has interesting separate things—a
capital, and, for an American at the moment, very magnanimous article
on Sydney Smith; two notable ones on Talfourd and “British
Critics”; early, and so valuable, notices of <cite>Jane Eyre</cite> and <cite>Vanity
Fair</cite>. A paper on “South’s Sermons” makes one regret that he did
not turn his attention more to older literature—perhaps he would
have had more doubts about the superiority of Pinkney if he had.
Again, he saw, what has often to this very day been foolishly denied,
the <em>intellectual</em> importance of Tennyson—in fact, he seems to have
been on the whole more disposed to the philosophical than to the
purely artistic side of poetry. Of perhaps his two most ambitious
essays the “Byron” has the commonplaceness which Byron’s eulogists
and detractors alike so commonly display; but the “Wordsworth”
is much better. He could hardly be called a critic of genius
or even of great talent, but he was fair, not ill-informed, interested
and disinterested (both in the good senses) and evidently
a “corn-and-seeds-man”—that is to say, a critic—“in his heart.”
Which things, if they could be said of all of us, so much the
better.</p>

<a id='seca.2.20'></a><div class='sidenote side4'><i>Lanier.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Sidney Lanier was, I believe, greatly thought of, and was the
object of still greater hopes on the part of those who knew him personally;
and though his career was cut short, there
appear in his remains such a love for literature, and such
an ardent desire to keep that love pure and high, that one cannot but
be well affected to him. It is, however, rather difficult to believe
that he would ever have been a really great, or even a fairly catholic
and competent, critic. Occasional utterances and <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, when the
planets were kind, must at most have been his portion. In the literature
of criticism, which has many strange things, there is hardly anything
odder than his <cite>The English Novel and the Principle of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>Development</cite>,<a id='r1165'></a><a href='#f1165' class='c010'><sup>[1165]</sup></a> which is simply a long, rather discursive, and wholly
laudatory review of George Eliot. The selection of the individual is
a matter of little consequence: I wish that I could save myself constant
repetition by printing across the dog’s-ear place of these pages
the warning, “<em>Never</em> judge a critic by your agreement with his likes
and dislikes.” But the narrowing down of so mighty a theme to the
glorification of <em>any</em> single novelist of a passing day would have been
enough to throw the gravest doubts on Mr Lanier’s competence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unluckily there is more. “The quiet and elegant narratives of
Miss Austen,” as the sole notice dealt out to its subject by the
author of a treatise on <i>the English Novel</i>, “speaks” that author with
a disastrous finality. A man need not go all lengths for Miss
Austen, just as he need not for Milton or Virgil; but if in a study
of Latin or English poetry as a whole he contented himself with
referring <span lang="la"><i>obiter</i></span> to “the elegant and scholarly verse of Virgil” and
the “serious and careful productions of Milton,” we should know
what to think of him. The oddest thing in Mr Lanier’s book, however,
is his intense, his obviously genuine, and I think his quite
nationally disinterested abhorrence<a id='r1166'></a><a href='#f1166' class='c010'><sup>[1166]</sup></a> of the “Four Masters”—of
Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne. <cite>Pamela</cite> is “a silly and
hideous realisation” of a really immoral idea. Fielding’s morality is
similar, but “more clownish.” Sterne “spent his life in low, brutish,
inane pursuits.” He “can read none of these books without feeling
as if his soul had been in the rain, draggled, muddy, miserable.”
He would “blot them from the face of the earth.” They are
“muck.” Praise of them is simply “well-meaning ignorance.” Is
it ungenerous in face of this last statement to ask whether it is well-meaning
<em>knowledge</em> which represents “Mr B.” not once but often as
not an orphan but a widower, and Pamela as the servant, not of his
mother but of his wife? I know that Mr Lanier died before he
could revise these lectures for publication. But the point happens
to be of some, if slight, importance, and when we take it in conjunction
with the facts that Mr Lanier thought admirers of <cite>Tom
Jones</cite> must centre their admiration on Allworthy, and that he accounted
for the unpopularity of <cite>Daniel Deronda</cite> by asserting that
English society felt its satire too keenly, our old brocard of <span lang="la"><i>judicia
ignorantium</i></span> doth something buzz i’ the ear.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>But Mr Lanier, though a younger man than Mr Lowell, was, to
say nothing of his inferiority in genius, practically a member of an
older school, corresponding, as I have already remarked, to one
which not all contemporaries of his had outgone in England itself, and
which, for the matter of that, we have not universally outgone even
now. Since his day American criticism (except for that in all
probability passing diversion into “Democratic” parochialism which
has been noticed) has become very much more cosmopolitan, very
much more fully developed, and in particular very much more
learned. It has perhaps, of the very latest years, gone a little too
much to Germany for patterns, and plunged too often into the
German <span lang="fr"><i>cul-de-sac</i></span> maze of specialist monographs—a dangerous and
soul-killing wilderness, wherein many positively foolish and hurtful
things are done, and where at the best the places are all too often
dry. Yet some of these very monographs have been executed in a
manner escaping the dangers and avoiding the drynesses, and not a
few both of the authors of them and of others have shown soul
and sight considerably above the mere trail-hunting of the specialist.
If all living American critics were to be carried off by a special
epidemic, I should be sorry for two reasons—first of all, because
several of them are my personal friends, and secondly, because I
should have to extend this appendix to an altogether unmanageable
length. But meanwhile there is no doubt that Mr Lowell handed
in, once for all, the “proofs” of American criticism, and that it has
nothing now to do but to go on and prosper.</p>

anything critical.  Mr Charles
F. Richardson in <cite>American Literature,
1607-1885</cite>  (New York and London:
Putnams, 1887), i. 396, says plumply,
“Criticism did not exist in this country
during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, nor did it make much showing
until the nineteenth century was
well advanced.” There is far less of
it, for instance, in Washington Irving
than one might expect. Perhaps some
may think that an exception ought to
be made for Channing. But his Essay
on Milton, which is the chief critical
thing of his known to me, produces
that sense of bafflement which, if I
remember rightly, Renan expresses in
regard to him on other grounds: “We
are aware that it is objected to poetry
that it gives wrong views of life....”
“We gaze on Satan with an awe not unmixed
with mysterious pleasure....”
&#38;c., &#38;c. With such matter we have

in the nineteenth it loses significance.</p>

and adapted “classical” system
of English prosody which could be
easily shown to justify almost all the

the badness of those which he thought
bad. He began this impatience quite

<p class='c001'>This volume includes, after the Preface, a number of corrections and notes
for the current volume, as well as volumes I and II. Those for Volume III
have been highlighted in red. <span class='htmlonly'>Moving the mouse over
the highlighted text will reveal the author’s intent.</span><span class='epubonly'>The
highlighted text serves as a link to the note in the ERRATA AND CORREGIENDA
section.</span></p>

<p class='c001'>No attempt was made to check the validity of each index entry’s references, however
several of them seem spurious:</p>
<p class='c029'>“Professor Pringle-Patterson” is referred to only in a note on p. 581, but the page mentioned in the Index is incorrectly given as p. 514.</p>

<p class='c030'>The entry for “Thomas Love Peacock” refers to a note on p. 207, but he is mentioned in none of those notes.  He is, however, mentioned in a <a href='#f309'>footnote</a> on p. 162. The page number has been changed.</p>

<p class='c030'>The second page reference (p. 137) for Adam Smith was incorrect. The correct page is p. 157, and has been changed.</p>
